chapter
i
down
the
rabbit-hole
alice
wa
beginning
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
bank
and
of
having
nothing
to
do
once
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
the
book
her
sister
wa
reading
but
it
had
no
picture
or
conversation
in
it
`and
what
is
the
use
of
a
book
thought
alice
`without
picture
or
conversation
so
she
wa
considering
in
her
own
mind
a
well
a
she
could
for
the
hot
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid
whether
the
pleasure
of
making
a
daisy-chain
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
picking
the
daisy
when
suddenly
a
white
rabbit
with
pink
eye
ran
close
by
her
there
wa
nothing
so
very
remarkable
in
that
nor
did
alice
think
it
so
very
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
rabbit
say
to
itself
`oh
dear
oh
dear
i
shall
be
late
when
she
thought
it
over
afterwards
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
wondered
at
this
but
at
the
time
it
all
seemed
quite
natural
but
when
the
rabbit
actually
took
a
watch
out
of
it
waistcoat-
pocket
and
looked
at
it
and
then
hurried
on
alice
started
to
her
foot
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
had
never
before
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
it
and
burning
with
curiosity
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it
and
fortunately
wa
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
large
rabbit-hole
under
the
hedge
in
another
moment
down
went
alice
after
it
never
once
considering
how
in
the
world
she
wa
to
get
out
again
the
rabbit-hole
went
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
way
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down
so
suddenly
that
alice
had
not
a
moment
to
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
found
herself
falling
down
a
very
deep
well
either
the
well
wa
very
deep
or
she
fell
very
slowly
for
she
had
plenty
of
time
a
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
wa
going
to
happen
next
first
she
tried
to
look
down
and
make
out
what
she
wa
coming
to
but
it
wa
too
dark
to
see
anything
then
she
looked
at
the
side
of
the
well
and
noticed
that
they
were
filled
with
cupboard
and
book-shelves
here
and
there
she
saw
map
and
picture
hung
upon
peg
she
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelf
a
she
passed
it
wa
labelled
`orange
marmalade
but
to
her
great
disappointment
it
wa
empty
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
killing
somebody
so
managed
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboard
a
she
fell
past
it
`well
thought
alice
to
herself
`after
such
a
fall
a
this
i
shall
think
nothing
of
tumbling
down
stair
how
brave
they'll
all
think
me
at
home
why
i
would
n't
say
anything
about
it
even
if
i
fell
off
the
top
of
the
house
which
wa
very
likely
true
down
down
down
would
the
fall
never
come
to
an
end
`i
wonder
how
many
mile
i
've
fallen
by
this
time
she
said
aloud
`i
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
centre
of
the
earth
let
me
see
that
would
be
four
thousand
mile
down
i
think
--
for
you
see
alice
had
learnt
several
thing
of
this
sort
in
her
lesson
in
the
schoolroom
and
though
this
wa
not
a
very
good
opportunity
for
showing
off
her
knowledge
a
there
wa
no
one
to
listen
to
her
still
it
wa
good
practice
to
say
it
over
--
yes
that
's
about
the
right
distance
--
but
then
i
wonder
what
latitude
or
longitude
i
've
got
to
alice
had
no
idea
what
latitude
wa
or
longitude
either
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
word
to
say
presently
she
began
again
`i
wonder
if
i
shall
fall
right
through
the
earth
how
funny
it
'll
seem
to
come
out
among
the
people
that
walk
with
their
head
downward
the
antipathy
i
think
--
she
wa
rather
glad
there
wa
no
one
listening
this
time
a
it
did
n't
sound
at
all
the
right
word
--
but
i
shall
have
to
ask
them
what
the
name
of
the
country
is
you
know
please
ma'am
is
this
new
zealand
or
australia
and
she
tried
to
curtsey
a
she
spoke
--
fancy
curtseying
a
you
're
falling
through
the
air
do
you
think
you
could
manage
it
`and
what
an
ignorant
little
girl
she
'll
think
me
for
asking
no
it'll
never
do
to
ask
perhaps
i
shall
see
it
written
up
somewhere
down
down
down
there
wa
nothing
else
to
do
so
alice
soon
began
talking
again
`dinah
'll
miss
me
very
much
to-night
i
should
think
dinah
wa
the
cat
`i
hope
they
'll
remember
her
saucer
of
milk
at
tea-time
dinah
my
dear
i
wish
you
were
down
here
with
me
there
are
no
mouse
in
the
air
i
'm
afraid
but
you
might
catch
a
bat
and
that
's
very
like
a
mouse
you
know
but
do
cat
eat
bat
i
wonder
and
here
alice
began
to
get
rather
sleepy
and
went
on
saying
to
herself
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
way
`do
cat
eat
bat
do
cat
eat
bat
and
sometimes
`do
bat
eat
cat
for
you
see
a
she
could
n't
answer
either
question
it
did
n't
much
matter
which
way
she
put
it
she
felt
that
she
wa
dozing
off
and
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
wa
walking
hand
in
hand
with
dinah
and
saying
to
her
very
earnestly
`now
dinah
tell
me
the
truth
did
you
ever
eat
a
bat
when
suddenly
thump
thump
down
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
stick
and
dry
leaf
and
the
fall
wa
over
alice
wa
not
a
bit
hurt
and
she
jumped
up
on
to
her
foot
in
a
moment
she
looked
up
but
it
wa
all
dark
overhead
before
her
wa
another
long
passage
and
the
white
rabbit
wa
still
in
sight
hurrying
down
it
there
wa
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
away
went
alice
like
the
wind
and
wa
just
in
time
to
hear
it
say
a
it
turned
a
corner
`oh
my
ear
and
whisker
how
late
it
's
getting
she
wa
close
behind
it
when
she
turned
the
corner
but
the
rabbit
wa
no
longer
to
be
seen
she
found
herself
in
a
long
low
hall
which
wa
lit
up
by
a
row
of
lamp
hanging
from
the
roof
there
were
door
all
round
the
hall
but
they
were
all
locked
and
when
alice
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
other
trying
every
door
she
walked
sadly
down
the
middle
wondering
how
she
wa
ever
to
get
out
again
suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
three-legged
table
all
made
of
solid
glass
there
wa
nothing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
key
and
alice
's
first
thought
wa
that
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
door
of
the
hall
but
ala
either
the
lock
were
too
large
or
the
key
wa
too
small
but
at
any
rate
it
would
not
open
any
of
them
however
on
the
second
time
round
she
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
before
and
behind
it
wa
a
little
door
about
fifteen
inch
high
she
tried
the
little
golden
key
in
the
lock
and
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted
alice
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
passage
not
much
larger
than
a
rat-hole
she
knelt
down
and
looked
along
the
passage
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
saw
how
she
longed
to
get
out
of
that
dark
hall
and
wander
about
among
those
bed
of
bright
flower
and
those
cool
fountain
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
the
doorway
`and
even
if
my
head
would
go
through
thought
poor
alice
`it
would
be
of
very
little
use
without
my
shoulder
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
shut
up
like
a
telescope
i
think
i
could
if
i
only
know
how
to
begin
for
you
see
so
many
out-of-the-way
thing
had
happened
lately
that
alice
had
begun
to
think
that
very
few
thing
indeed
were
really
impossible
there
seemed
to
be
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
little
door
so
she
went
back
to
the
table
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
it
or
at
any
rate
a
book
of
rule
for
shutting
people
up
like
telescope
this
time
she
found
a
little
bottle
on
it
`which
certainly
wa
not
here
before
said
alice
and
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
wa
a
paper
label
with
the
word
`drink
me'
beautifully
printed
on
it
in
large
letter
it
wa
all
very
well
to
say
`drink
me
but
the
wise
little
alice
wa
not
going
to
do
that
in
a
hurry
`no
i
'll
look
first
she
said
`and
see
whether
it
's
marked
``
poison
''
or
not
for
she
had
read
several
nice
little
history
about
child
who
had
got
burnt
and
eaten
up
by
wild
beast
and
other
unpleasant
thing
all
because
they
would
not
remember
the
simple
rule
their
friend
had
taught
them
such
a
that
a
red-hot
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
it
too
long
and
that
if
you
cut
your
finger
very
deeply
with
a
knife
it
usually
bleeds
and
she
had
never
forgotten
that
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
marked
`poison
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you
sooner
or
later
however
this
bottle
wa
not
marked
`poison
so
alice
ventured
to
taste
it
and
finding
it
very
nice
it
had
in
fact
a
sort
of
mixed
flavour
of
cherry-tart
custard
pine-apple
roast
turkey
toffee
and
hot
buttered
toast
she
very
soon
finished
it
off
`what
a
curious
feeling
said
alice
`i
must
be
shutting
up
like
a
telescope
and
so
it
wa
indeed
she
wa
now
only
ten
inch
high
and
her
face
brightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
wa
now
the
right
size
for
going
through
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden
first
however
she
waited
for
a
few
minute
to
see
if
she
wa
going
to
shrink
any
further
she
felt
a
little
nervous
about
this
`for
it
might
end
you
know
said
alice
to
herself
`in
my
going
out
altogether
like
a
candle
i
wonder
what
i
should
be
like
then
and
she
tried
to
fancy
what
the
flame
of
a
candle
is
like
after
the
candle
is
blown
out
for
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
a
thing
after
a
while
finding
that
nothing
more
happened
she
decided
on
going
into
the
garden
at
once
but
ala
for
poor
alice
when
she
got
to
the
door
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
key
and
when
she
went
back
to
the
table
for
it
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
it
she
could
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
glass
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
leg
of
the
table
but
it
wa
too
slippery
and
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
trying
the
poor
little
thing
sat
down
and
cried
`come
there
's
no
use
in
cry
like
that
said
alice
to
herself
rather
sharply
`i
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
minute
she
generally
gave
herself
very
good
advice
though
she
very
seldom
followed
it
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
a
to
bring
tear
into
her
eye
and
once
she
remembered
trying
to
box
her
own
ear
for
having
cheated
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
wa
playing
against
herself
for
this
curious
child
wa
very
fond
of
pretending
to
be
two
people
`but
it
's
no
use
now
thought
poor
alice
`to
pretend
to
be
two
people
why
there
's
hardly
enough
of
me
left
to
make
one
respectable
person
soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
wa
lying
under
the
table
she
opened
it
and
found
in
it
a
very
small
cake
on
which
the
word
`eat
me
were
beautifully
marked
in
currant
`well
i
'll
eat
it
said
alice
`and
if
it
make
me
grow
larger
i
can
reach
the
key
and
if
it
make
me
grow
smaller
i
can
creep
under
the
door
so
either
way
i
'll
get
into
the
garden
and
i
do
n't
care
which
happens
she
ate
a
little
bit
and
said
anxiously
to
herself
`which
way
which
way
holding
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
wa
growing
and
she
wa
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
same
size
to
be
sure
this
generally
happens
when
one
eats
cake
but
alice
had
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
out-of-the-way
thing
to
happen
that
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
on
in
the
common
way
so
she
set
to
work
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake
chapter
ii
the
pool
of
tear
`curiouser
and
curiouser
cried
alice
she
wa
so
much
surprised
that
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
speak
good
english
`now
i
'm
opening
out
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
wa
good-bye
foot
for
when
she
looked
down
at
her
foot
they
seemed
to
be
almost
out
of
sight
they
were
getting
so
far
off
`oh
my
poor
little
foot
i
wonder
who
will
put
on
your
shoe
and
stocking
for
you
now
dear
i
'm
sure
_i_
shan't
be
able
i
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
trouble
myself
about
you
you
must
manage
the
best
way
you
can
--
but
i
must
be
kind
to
them
thought
alice
`or
perhaps
they
wo
n't
walk
the
way
i
want
to
go
let
me
see
i
'll
give
them
a
new
pair
of
boot
every
christmas
and
she
went
on
planning
to
herself
how
she
would
manage
it
`they
must
go
by
the
carrier
she
thought
`and
how
funny
it'll
seem
sending
present
to
one
's
own
foot
and
how
odd
the
direction
will
look
alice
's
right
foot
esq
hearthrug
near
the
fender
with
alice
's
love
oh
dear
what
nonsense
i
'm
talking
just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
hall
in
fact
she
wa
now
more
than
nine
foot
high
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
to
the
garden
door
poor
alice
it
wa
a
much
a
she
could
do
lying
down
on
one
side
to
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
eye
but
to
get
through
wa
more
hopeless
than
ever
she
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
again
`you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
alice
`a
great
girl
like
you
she
might
well
say
this
`to
go
on
cry
in
this
way
stop
this
moment
i
tell
you
but
she
went
on
all
the
same
shedding
gallon
of
tear
until
there
wa
a
large
pool
all
round
her
about
four
inch
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the
hall
after
a
time
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
foot
in
the
distance
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eye
to
see
what
wa
coming
it
wa
the
white
rabbit
returning
splendidly
dressed
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
glove
in
one
hand
and
a
large
fan
in
the
other
he
came
trotting
along
in
a
great
hurry
muttering
to
himself
a
he
came
`oh
the
duchess
the
duchess
oh
wo
n't
she
be
savage
if
i
've
kept
her
waiting
alice
felt
so
desperate
that
she
wa
ready
to
ask
help
of
any
one
so
when
the
rabbit
came
near
her
she
began
in
a
low
timid
voice
`if
you
please
sir
--
the
rabbit
started
violently
dropped
the
white
kid
glove
and
the
fan
and
skurried
away
into
the
darkness
a
hard
a
he
could
go
alice
took
up
the
fan
and
glove
and
a
the
hall
wa
very
hot
she
kept
fanning
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
talking
`dear
dear
how
queer
everything
is
to-day
and
yesterday
thing
went
on
just
a
usual
i
wonder
if
i
've
been
changed
in
the
night
let
me
think
wa
i
the
same
when
i
got
up
this
morning
i
almost
think
i
can
remember
feeling
a
little
different
but
if
i
'm
not
the
same
the
next
question
is
who
in
the
world
am
i
ah
that
's
the
great
puzzle
and
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
child
she
knew
that
were
of
the
same
age
a
herself
to
see
if
she
could
have
been
changed
for
any
of
them
`i
'm
sure
i
'm
not
ada
she
said
`for
her
hair
go
in
such
long
ringlet
and
mine
doe
n't
go
in
ringlet
at
all
and
i'm
sure
i
ca
n't
be
mabel
for
i
know
all
sort
of
thing
and
she
oh
she
know
such
a
very
little
besides
she
's
she
and
i
'm
i
and
--
oh
dear
how
puzzling
it
all
is
i
'll
try
if
i
know
all
the
thing
i
used
to
know
let
me
see
four
time
five
is
twelve
and
four
time
six
is
thirteen
and
four
time
seven
is
--
oh
dear
i
shall
never
get
to
twenty
at
that
rate
however
the
multiplication
table
doe
n't
signify
let
's
try
geography
london
is
the
capital
of
paris
and
paris
is
the
capital
of
rome
and
rome
--
no
that
's
all
wrong
i
'm
certain
i
must
have
been
changed
for
mabel
i
'll
try
and
say
``
how
doth
the
little
--
''
and
she
crossed
her
hand
on
her
lap
a
if
she
were
saying
lesson
and
began
to
repeat
it
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange
and
the
word
did
not
come
the
same
a
they
used
to
do
--
`how
doth
the
little
crocodile
improve
his
shining
tail
and
pour
the
water
of
the
nile
on
every
golden
scale
`how
cheerfully
he
seems
to
grin
how
neatly
spread
his
claw
and
welcome
little
fish
in
with
gently
smiling
jaw
`i
'm
sure
those
are
not
the
right
word
said
poor
alice
and
her
eye
filled
with
tear
again
a
she
went
on
`i
must
be
mabel
after
all
and
i
shall
have
to
go
and
live
in
that
poky
little
house
and
have
next
to
no
toy
to
play
with
and
oh
ever
so
many
lesson
to
learn
no
i
've
made
up
my
mind
about
it
if
i'm
mabel
i
'll
stay
down
here
it
'll
be
no
use
their
putting
their
head
down
and
saying
``
come
up
again
dear
''
i
shall
only
look
up
and
say
``
who
am
i
then
tell
me
that
first
and
then
if
i
like
being
that
person
i
'll
come
up
if
not
i
'll
stay
down
here
till
i
'm
somebody
else
''
--
but
oh
dear
cried
alice
with
a
sudden
burst
of
tear
`i
do
wish
they
would
put
their
head
down
i
am
so
very
tired
of
being
all
alone
here
a
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
hand
and
wa
surprised
to
see
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
rabbit
's
little
white
kid
glove
while
she
wa
talking
`how
can
i
have
done
that
she
thought
`i
must
be
growing
small
again
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
it
and
found
that
a
nearly
a
she
could
guess
she
wa
now
about
two
foot
high
and
wa
going
on
shrinking
rapidly
she
soon
found
out
that
the
cause
of
this
wa
the
fan
she
wa
holding
and
she
dropped
it
hastily
just
in
time
to
avoid
shrinking
away
altogether
`that
wa
a
narrow
escape
said
alice
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
sudden
change
but
very
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
existence
`and
now
for
the
garden
and
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
little
door
but
ala
the
little
door
wa
shut
again
and
the
little
golden
key
wa
lying
on
the
glass
table
a
before
`and
thing
are
worse
than
ever
thought
the
poor
child
`for
i
never
wa
so
small
a
this
before
never
and
i
declare
it
's
too
bad
that
it
is
a
she
said
these
word
her
foot
slipped
and
in
another
moment
splash
she
wa
up
to
her
chin
in
salt
water
her
first
idea
wa
that
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
sea
`and
in
that
case
i
can
go
back
by
railway
she
said
to
herself
alice
had
been
to
the
seaside
once
in
her
life
and
had
come
to
the
general
conclusion
that
wherever
you
go
to
on
the
english
coast
you
find
a
number
of
bathing
machine
in
the
sea
some
child
digging
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spade
then
a
row
of
lodging
house
and
behind
them
a
railway
station
however
she
soon
made
out
that
she
wa
in
the
pool
of
tear
which
she
had
wept
when
she
wa
nine
foot
high
`i
wish
i
had
n't
cried
so
much
said
alice
a
she
swam
about
trying
to
find
her
way
out
`i
shall
be
punished
for
it
now
i
suppose
by
being
drowned
in
my
own
tear
that
will
be
a
queer
thing
to
be
sure
however
everything
is
queer
to-day
just
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in
the
pool
a
little
way
off
and
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
wa
at
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus
but
then
she
remembered
how
small
she
wa
now
and
she
soon
made
out
that
it
wa
only
a
mouse
that
had
slipped
in
like
herself
`would
it
be
of
any
use
now
thought
alice
`to
speak
to
this
mouse
everything
is
so
out-of-the-way
down
here
that
i
should
think
very
likely
it
can
talk
at
any
rate
there
's
no
harm
in
trying
so
she
began
`o
mouse
do
you
know
the
way
out
of
this
pool
i
am
very
tired
of
swimming
about
here
o
mouse
alice
thought
this
must
be
the
right
way
of
speaking
to
a
mouse
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
but
she
remembered
having
seen
in
her
brother
's
latin
grammar
`a
mouse
--
of
a
mouse
--
to
a
mouse
--
a
mouse
--
o
mouse
the
mouse
looked
at
her
rather
inquisitively
and
seemed
to
her
to
wink
with
one
of
it
little
eye
but
it
said
nothing
`perhaps
it
doe
n't
understand
english
thought
alice
`i
daresay
it
's
a
french
mouse
come
over
with
william
the
conqueror
for
with
all
her
knowledge
of
history
alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened
so
she
began
again
`ou
est
ma
chatte
which
wa
the
first
sentence
in
her
french
lesson-book
the
mouse
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
water
and
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
with
fright
`oh
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
alice
hastily
afraid
that
she
had
hurt
the
poor
animal
's
feeling
`i
quite
forgot
you
did
n't
like
cat
`not
like
cat
cried
the
mouse
in
a
shrill
passionate
voice
`would
you
like
cat
if
you
were
me
`well
perhaps
not
said
alice
in
a
soothing
tone
`do
n't
be
angry
about
it
and
yet
i
wish
i
could
show
you
our
cat
dinah
i
think
you
'd
take
a
fancy
to
cat
if
you
could
only
see
her
she
is
such
a
dear
quiet
thing
alice
went
on
half
to
herself
a
she
swam
lazily
about
in
the
pool
`and
she
sits
purring
so
nicely
by
the
fire
licking
her
paw
and
washing
her
face
--
and
she
is
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
nurse
--
and
she
's
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mouse
--
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
alice
again
for
this
time
the
mouse
wa
bristling
all
over
and
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
really
offended
`we
wo
n't
talk
about
her
any
more
if
you
'd
rather
not
`we
indeed
cried
the
mouse
who
wa
trembling
down
to
the
end
of
his
tail
`as
if
i
would
talk
on
such
a
subject
our
family
always
hated
cat
nasty
low
vulgar
thing
do
n't
let
me
hear
the
name
again
`i
wo
n't
indeed
said
alice
in
a
great
hurry
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
`are
you
--
are
you
fond
--
of
--
of
dog
the
mouse
did
not
answer
so
alice
went
on
eagerly
`there
is
such
a
nice
little
dog
near
our
house
i
should
like
to
show
you
a
little
bright-eyed
terrier
you
know
with
oh
such
long
curly
brown
hair
and
it
'll
fetch
thing
when
you
throw
them
and
it
'll
sit
up
and
beg
for
it
dinner
and
all
sort
of
thing
--
i
ca
n't
remember
half
of
them
--
and
it
belongs
to
a
farmer
you
know
and
he
say
it
's
so
useful
it
's
worth
a
hundred
pound
he
say
it
kill
all
the
rat
and
--
oh
dear
cried
alice
in
a
sorrowful
tone
`i
'm
afraid
i
've
offended
it
again
for
the
mouse
wa
swimming
away
from
her
a
hard
a
it
could
go
and
making
quite
a
commotion
in
the
pool
a
it
went
so
she
called
softly
after
it
`mouse
dear
do
come
back
again
and
we
wo
n't
talk
about
cat
or
dog
either
if
you
don't
like
them
when
the
mouse
heard
this
it
turned
round
and
swam
slowly
back
to
her
it
face
wa
quite
pale
with
passion
alice
thought
and
it
said
in
a
low
trembling
voice
`let
u
get
to
the
shore
and
then
i
'll
tell
you
my
history
and
you'll
understand
why
it
is
i
hate
cat
and
dog
it
wa
high
time
to
go
for
the
pool
wa
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
bird
and
animal
that
had
fallen
into
it
there
were
a
duck
and
a
dodo
a
lory
and
an
eaglet
and
several
other
curious
creature
alice
led
the
way
and
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
shore
chapter
iii
a
caucus-race
and
a
long
tale
they
were
indeed
a
queer-looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
bank
--
the
bird
with
draggled
feather
the
animal
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
them
and
all
dripping
wet
cross
and
uncomfortable
the
first
question
of
course
wa
how
to
get
dry
again
they
had
a
consultation
about
this
and
after
a
few
minute
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
alice
to
find
herself
talking
familiarly
with
them
a
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
indeed
she
had
quite
a
long
argument
with
the
lory
who
at
last
turned
sulky
and
would
only
say
`i
am
older
than
you
and
must
know
better
and
this
alice
would
not
allow
without
knowing
how
old
it
wa
and
a
the
lory
positively
refused
to
tell
it
age
there
wa
no
more
to
be
said
at
last
the
mouse
who
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
authority
among
them
called
out
`sit
down
all
of
you
and
listen
to
me
i'll
soon
make
you
dry
enough
they
all
sat
down
at
once
in
a
large
ring
with
the
mouse
in
the
middle
alice
kept
her
eye
anxiously
fixed
on
it
for
she
felt
sure
she
would
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
did
not
get
dry
very
soon
`ahem
said
the
mouse
with
an
important
air
`are
you
all
ready
this
is
the
driest
thing
i
know
silence
all
round
if
you
please
``
william
the
conqueror
whose
cause
wa
favoured
by
the
pope
wa
soon
submitted
to
by
the
english
who
wanted
leader
and
had
been
of
late
much
accustomed
to
usurpation
and
conquest
edwin
and
morcar
the
earl
of
mercia
and
northumbria
--
''
`ugh
said
the
lory
with
a
shiver
`i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
mouse
frowning
but
very
politely
`did
you
speak
`not
i
said
the
lory
hastily
`i
thought
you
did
said
the
mouse
--
i
proceed
``
edwin
and
morcar
the
earl
of
mercia
and
northumbria
declared
for
him
and
even
stigand
the
patriotic
archbishop
of
canterbury
found
it
advisable
--
''
`found
what
said
the
duck
`found
it
the
mouse
replied
rather
crossly
`of
course
you
know
what
``
it
''
mean
`i
know
what
``
it
''
mean
well
enough
when
i
find
a
thing
said
the
duck
`it
's
generally
a
frog
or
a
worm
the
question
is
what
did
the
archbishop
find
the
mouse
did
not
notice
this
question
but
hurriedly
went
on
''
--
found
it
advisable
to
go
with
edgar
atheling
to
meet
william
and
offer
him
the
crown
william
's
conduct
at
first
wa
moderate
but
the
insolence
of
his
norman
--
''
how
are
you
getting
on
now
my
dear
it
continued
turning
to
alice
a
it
spoke
`as
wet
a
ever
said
alice
in
a
melancholy
tone
`it
doesn't
seem
to
dry
me
at
all
`in
that
case
said
the
dodo
solemnly
rising
to
it
foot
`i
move
that
the
meeting
adjourn
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
energetic
remedy
--
`speak
english
said
the
eaglet
`i
do
n't
know
the
meaning
of
half
those
long
word
and
what
's
more
i
do
n't
believe
you
do
either
and
the
eaglet
bent
down
it
head
to
hide
a
smile
some
of
the
other
bird
tittered
audibly
`what
i
wa
going
to
say
said
the
dodo
in
an
offended
tone
`was
that
the
best
thing
to
get
u
dry
would
be
a
caucus-race
`what
is
a
caucus-race
said
alice
not
that
she
wanted
much
to
know
but
the
dodo
had
paused
a
if
it
thought
that
somebody
ought
to
speak
and
no
one
else
seemed
inclined
to
say
anything
`why
said
the
dodo
`the
best
way
to
explain
it
is
to
do
it
and
a
you
might
like
to
try
the
thing
yourself
some
winter
day
i
will
tell
you
how
the
dodo
managed
it
first
it
marked
out
a
race-course
in
a
sort
of
circle
`the
exact
shape
doe
n't
matter
it
said
and
then
all
the
party
were
placed
along
the
course
here
and
there
there
wa
no
`one
two
three
and
away
but
they
began
running
when
they
liked
and
left
off
when
they
liked
so
that
it
wa
not
easy
to
know
when
the
race
wa
over
however
when
they
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
and
were
quite
dry
again
the
dodo
suddenly
called
out
`the
race
is
over
and
they
all
crowded
round
it
panting
and
asking
`but
who
ha
won
this
question
the
dodo
could
not
answer
without
a
great
deal
of
thought
and
it
sat
for
a
long
time
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
it
forehead
the
position
in
which
you
usually
see
shakespeare
in
the
picture
of
him
while
the
rest
waited
in
silence
at
last
the
dodo
said
`everybody
ha
won
and
all
must
have
prize
`but
who
is
to
give
the
prize
quite
a
chorus
of
voice
asked
`why
she
of
course
said
the
dodo
pointing
to
alice
with
one
finger
and
the
whole
party
at
once
crowded
round
her
calling
out
in
a
confused
way
`prizes
prize
alice
had
no
idea
what
to
do
and
in
despair
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
box
of
comfit
luckily
the
salt
water
had
not
got
into
it
and
handed
them
round
a
prize
there
wa
exactly
one
a-piece
all
round
`but
she
must
have
a
prize
herself
you
know
said
the
mouse
`of
course
the
dodo
replied
very
gravely
`what
else
have
you
got
in
your
pocket
he
went
on
turning
to
alice
`only
a
thimble
said
alice
sadly
`hand
it
over
here
said
the
dodo
then
they
all
crowded
round
her
once
more
while
the
dodo
solemnly
presented
the
thimble
saying
`we
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
elegant
thimble
and
when
it
had
finished
this
short
speech
they
all
cheered
alice
thought
the
whole
thing
very
absurd
but
they
all
looked
so
grave
that
she
did
not
dare
to
laugh
and
a
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
she
simply
bowed
and
took
the
thimble
looking
a
solemn
a
she
could
the
next
thing
wa
to
eat
the
comfit
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion
a
the
large
bird
complained
that
they
could
not
taste
theirs
and
the
small
one
choked
and
had
to
be
patted
on
the
back
however
it
wa
over
at
last
and
they
sat
down
again
in
a
ring
and
begged
the
mouse
to
tell
them
something
more
`you
promised
to
tell
me
your
history
you
know
said
alice
`and
why
it
is
you
hate
--
c
and
d
she
added
in
a
whisper
half
afraid
that
it
would
be
offended
again
`mine
is
a
long
and
a
sad
tale
said
the
mouse
turning
to
alice
and
sighing
`it
is
a
long
tail
certainly
said
alice
looking
down
with
wonder
at
the
mouse
's
tail
`but
why
do
you
call
it
sad
and
she
kept
on
puzzling
about
it
while
the
mouse
wa
speaking
so
that
her
idea
of
the
tale
wa
something
like
this
--
`fury
said
to
a
mouse
that
he
met
in
the
house
``
let
u
both
go
to
law
i
will
prosecute
you
--
come
i
'll
take
no
denial
we
must
have
a
trial
for
really
this
morning
i've
nothing
to
do
''
said
the
mouse
to
the
cur
``
such
a
trial
dear
sir
with
no
jury
or
judge
would
be
wasting
our
breath
''
``
i
'll
be
judge
i'll
be
jury
''
said
cunning
old
fury
``
i'll
try
the
whole
cause
and
condemn
you
to
death
''
`you
are
not
attending
said
the
mouse
to
alice
severely
`what
are
you
thinking
of
`i
beg
your
pardon
said
alice
very
humbly
`you
had
got
to
the
fifth
bend
i
think
`i
had
not
cried
the
mouse
sharply
and
very
angrily
`a
knot
said
alice
always
ready
to
make
herself
useful
and
looking
anxiously
about
her
`oh
do
let
me
help
to
undo
it
`i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
the
mouse
getting
up
and
walking
away
`you
insult
me
by
talking
such
nonsense
`i
did
n't
mean
it
pleaded
poor
alice
`but
you
're
so
easily
offended
you
know
the
mouse
only
growled
in
reply
`please
come
back
and
finish
your
story
alice
called
after
it
and
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus
`yes
please
do
but
the
mouse
only
shook
it
head
impatiently
and
walked
a
little
quicker
`what
a
pity
it
would
n't
stay
sighed
the
lory
a
soon
a
it
wa
quite
out
of
sight
and
an
old
crab
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
to
her
daughter
`ah
my
dear
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
lose
your
temper
`hold
your
tongue
ma
said
the
young
crab
a
little
snappishly
`you
're
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
an
oyster
`i
wish
i
had
our
dinah
here
i
know
i
do
said
alice
aloud
addressing
nobody
in
particular
`she
'd
soon
fetch
it
back
`and
who
is
dinah
if
i
might
venture
to
ask
the
question
said
the
lory
alice
replied
eagerly
for
she
wa
always
ready
to
talk
about
her
pet
`dinah
's
our
cat
and
she
's
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mouse
you
ca
n't
think
and
oh
i
wish
you
could
see
her
after
the
bird
why
she
'll
eat
a
little
bird
a
soon
a
look
at
it
this
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
party
some
of
the
bird
hurried
off
at
once
one
old
magpie
began
wrapping
itself
up
very
carefully
remarking
`i
really
must
be
getting
home
the
night-air
doe
n't
suit
my
throat
and
a
canary
called
out
in
a
trembling
voice
to
it
child
`come
away
my
dear
it
's
high
time
you
were
all
in
bed
on
various
pretext
they
all
moved
off
and
alice
wa
soon
left
alone
`i
wish
i
had
n't
mentioned
dinah
she
said
to
herself
in
a
melancholy
tone
`nobody
seems
to
like
her
down
here
and
i'm
sure
she
's
the
best
cat
in
the
world
oh
my
dear
dinah
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
you
any
more
and
here
poor
alice
began
to
cry
again
for
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low-spirited
in
a
little
while
however
she
again
heard
a
little
pattering
of
footstep
in
the
distance
and
she
looked
up
eagerly
half
hoping
that
the
mouse
had
changed
his
mind
and
wa
coming
back
to
finish
his
story
chapter
iv
the
rabbit
sends
in
a
little
bill
it
wa
the
white
rabbit
trotting
slowly
back
again
and
looking
anxiously
about
a
it
went
a
if
it
had
lost
something
and
she
heard
it
muttering
to
itself
`the
duchess
the
duchess
oh
my
dear
paw
oh
my
fur
and
whisker
she
'll
get
me
executed
a
sure
a
ferret
are
ferret
where
can
i
have
dropped
them
i
wonder
alice
guessed
in
a
moment
that
it
wa
looking
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
glove
and
she
very
good-naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
them
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
--
everything
seemed
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
pool
and
the
great
hall
with
the
glass
table
and
the
little
door
had
vanished
completely
very
soon
the
rabbit
noticed
alice
a
she
went
hunting
about
and
called
out
to
her
in
an
angry
tone
`why
mary
ann
what
are
you
doing
out
here
run
home
this
moment
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
glove
and
a
fan
quick
now
and
alice
wa
so
much
frightened
that
she
ran
off
at
once
in
the
direction
it
pointed
to
without
trying
to
explain
the
mistake
it
had
made
`he
took
me
for
his
housemaid
she
said
to
herself
a
she
ran
`how
surprised
he
'll
be
when
he
find
out
who
i
am
but
i'd
better
take
him
his
fan
and
glove
--
that
is
if
i
can
find
them
a
she
said
this
she
came
upon
a
neat
little
house
on
the
door
of
which
wa
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
name
`w.
rabbit'
engraved
upon
it
she
went
in
without
knocking
and
hurried
upstairs
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
mary
ann
and
be
turned
out
of
the
house
before
she
had
found
the
fan
and
glove
`how
queer
it
seems
alice
said
to
herself
`to
be
going
message
for
a
rabbit
i
suppose
dinah
'll
be
sending
me
on
message
next
and
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
happen
''
miss
alice
come
here
directly
and
get
ready
for
your
walk
''
``
coming
in
a
minute
nurse
but
i
've
got
to
see
that
the
mouse
doe
n't
get
out
''
only
i
do
n't
think
alice
went
on
`that
they
'd
let
dinah
stop
in
the
house
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that
by
this
time
she
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
table
in
the
window
and
on
it
a
she
had
hoped
a
fan
and
two
or
three
pair
of
tiny
white
kid
glove
she
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
glove
and
wa
just
going
to
leave
the
room
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
looking-
glass
there
wa
no
label
this
time
with
the
word
`drink
me
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
it
to
her
lip
`i
know
something
interesting
is
sure
to
happen
she
said
to
herself
`whenever
i
eat
or
drink
anything
so
i
'll
just
see
what
this
bottle
doe
i
do
hope
it
'll
make
me
grow
large
again
for
really
i
'm
quite
tired
of
being
such
a
tiny
little
thing
it
did
so
indeed
and
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected
before
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle
she
found
her
head
pressing
against
the
ceiling
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
broken
she
hastily
put
down
the
bottle
saying
to
herself
`that
's
quite
enough
--
i
hope
i
sha
n't
grow
any
more
--
a
it
is
i
ca
n't
get
out
at
the
door
--
i
do
wish
i
had
n't
drunk
quite
so
much
ala
it
wa
too
late
to
wish
that
she
went
on
growing
and
growing
and
very
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
floor
in
another
minute
there
wa
not
even
room
for
this
and
she
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
with
one
elbow
against
the
door
and
the
other
arm
curled
round
her
head
still
she
went
on
growing
and
a
a
last
resource
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
window
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney
and
said
to
herself
`now
i
can
do
no
more
whatever
happens
what
will
become
of
me
luckily
for
alice
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
it
full
effect
and
she
grew
no
larger
still
it
wa
very
uncomfortable
and
a
there
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
chance
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
room
again
no
wonder
she
felt
unhappy
`it
wa
much
pleasanter
at
home
thought
poor
alice
`when
one
wa
n't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller
and
being
ordered
about
by
mouse
and
rabbit
i
almost
wish
i
had
n't
gone
down
that
rabbit-hole
--
and
yet
--
and
yet
--
it
's
rather
curious
you
know
this
sort
of
life
i
do
wonder
what
can
have
happened
to
me
when
i
used
to
read
fairy-tales
i
fancied
that
kind
of
thing
never
happened
and
now
here
i
am
in
the
middle
of
one
there
ought
to
be
a
book
written
about
me
that
there
ought
and
when
i
grow
up
i
'll
write
one
--
but
i
'm
grown
up
now
she
added
in
a
sorrowful
tone
`at
least
there
's
no
room
to
grow
up
any
more
here
`but
then
thought
alice
`shall
i
never
get
any
older
than
i
am
now
that
'll
be
a
comfort
one
way
--
never
to
be
an
old
woman
--
but
then
--
always
to
have
lesson
to
learn
oh
i
should
n't
like
that
`oh
you
foolish
alice
she
answered
herself
`how
can
you
learn
lesson
in
here
why
there
's
hardly
room
for
you
and
no
room
at
all
for
any
lesson-books
and
so
she
went
on
taking
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
and
making
quite
a
conversation
of
it
altogether
but
after
a
few
minute
she
heard
a
voice
outside
and
stopped
to
listen
`mary
ann
mary
ann
said
the
voice
`fetch
me
my
glove
this
moment
then
came
a
little
pattering
of
foot
on
the
stair
alice
knew
it
wa
the
rabbit
coming
to
look
for
her
and
she
trembled
till
she
shook
the
house
quite
forgetting
that
she
wa
now
about
a
thousand
time
a
large
a
the
rabbit
and
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
it
presently
the
rabbit
came
up
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
but
a
the
door
opened
inwards
and
alice
's
elbow
wa
pressed
hard
against
it
that
attempt
proved
a
failure
alice
heard
it
say
to
itself
`then
i
'll
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
window
`that
you
wo
n't
thought
alice
and
after
waiting
till
she
fancied
she
heard
the
rabbit
just
under
the
window
she
suddenly
spread
out
her
hand
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
air
she
did
not
get
hold
of
anything
but
she
heard
a
little
shriek
and
a
fall
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
wa
just
possible
it
had
fallen
into
a
cucumber-frame
or
something
of
the
sort
next
came
an
angry
voice
--
the
rabbit
's
--
`pat
pat
where
are
you
and
then
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
`sure
then
i
'm
here
digging
for
apple
yer
honour
`digging
for
apple
indeed
said
the
rabbit
angrily
`here
come
and
help
me
out
of
this
sound
of
more
broken
glass
`now
tell
me
pat
what
's
that
in
the
window
`sure
it
's
an
arm
yer
honour
he
pronounced
it
`arrum
`an
arm
you
goose
who
ever
saw
one
that
size
why
it
fill
the
whole
window
`sure
it
doe
yer
honour
but
it
's
an
arm
for
all
that
`well
it
's
got
no
business
there
at
any
rate
go
and
take
it
away
there
wa
a
long
silence
after
this
and
alice
could
only
hear
whisper
now
and
then
such
a
`sure
i
do
n't
like
it
yer
honour
at
all
at
all
`do
a
i
tell
you
you
coward
and
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
again
and
made
another
snatch
in
the
air
this
time
there
were
two
little
shriek
and
more
sound
of
broken
glass
`what
a
number
of
cucumber-frames
there
must
be
thought
alice
`i
wonder
what
they
'll
do
next
a
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
window
i
only
wish
they
could
i
'm
sure
i
do
n't
want
to
stay
in
here
any
longer
she
waited
for
some
time
without
hearing
anything
more
at
last
came
a
rumbling
of
little
cartwheel
and
the
sound
of
a
good
many
voice
all
talking
together
she
made
out
the
word
`where
's
the
other
ladder
--
why
i
had
n't
to
bring
but
one
bill
's
got
the
other
--
bill

--

'em
up
at
this
corner
--
no
tie

together
first
--

do
n't
reach
half
high
enough
yet
--
oh

'll
do
well
enough
do
n't
be
particular
--
here
bill
catch
hold
of
this
rope
--
will
the
roof
bear
--
mind
that
loose
slate
--
oh
it
's
coming
down
head
below
a
loud
crash
--
`now
who
did
that
--
it
wa
bill
i
fancy
--
who
's
to
go
down
the
chimney
--
nay
i
sha

--
that
i
wo

then
--
bill
's
to
go
down
--
here
bill
the
master
say
you
're
to
go
down
the
chimney
`oh
so
bill
's
got
to
come
down
the
chimney
ha
he
said
alice
to
herself
`shy
they
seem
to
put
everything
upon
bill
i
would
n't
be
in
bill
's
place
for
a
good
deal
this
fireplace
is
narrow
to
be
sure
but
i
think
i
can
kick
a
little
she
drew
her
foot
a
far
down
the
chimney
a
she
could
and
waited
till
she
heard
a
little
animal
she
could
n't
guess
of
what
sort
it
wa
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
chimney
close
above
her
then
saying
to
herself
`this
is
bill
she
gave
one
sharp
kick
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
next
the
first
thing
she
heard
wa
a
general
chorus
of
`there
go
bill
then
the
rabbit
's
voice
along
--
`catch
him
you
by
the
hedge
then
silence
and
then
another
confusion
of
voice
--
`hold
up
his
head
--
brandy
now
--
do
n't
choke
him
--
how
wa
it
old
fellow
what
happened
to
you
tell
u
all
about
it
last
came
a
little
feeble
squeaking
voice
`that
's
bill
thought
alice
`well
i
hardly
know
--
no
more
thank
ye
i'm
better
now
--
but
i
'm
a
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
you
--
all
i
know
is
something
come
at
me
like
a
jack-in-the-box
and
up
i
go
like
a
sky-rocket
`so
you
did
old
fellow
said
the
others
`we
must
burn
the
house
down
said
the
rabbit
's
voice
and
alice
called
out
a
loud
a
she
could
`if
you
do
i
'll
set
dinah
at
you
there
wa
a
dead
silence
instantly
and
alice
thought
to
herself
`i
wonder
what
they
will
do
next
if
they
had
any
sense
they
'd
take
the
roof
off
after
a
minute
or
two
they
began
moving
about
again
and
alice
heard
the
rabbit
say
`a
barrowful
will
do
to
begin
with
`a
barrowful
of
what
thought
alice
but
she
had
not
long
to
doubt
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
pebble
came
rattling
in
at
the
window
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
face
`i
'll
put
a
stop
to
this
she
said
to
herself
and
shouted
out
`you
'd
better
not
do
that
again
which
produced
another
dead
silence
alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebble
were
all
turning
into
little
cake
a
they
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
head
`if
i
eat
one
of
these
cake
she
thought
`it
's
sure
to
make
some
change
in
my
size
and
a
it
ca
n't
possibly
make
me
larger
it
must
make
me
smaller
i
suppose
so
she
swallowed
one
of
the
cake
and
wa
delighted
to
find
that
she
began
shrinking
directly
a
soon
a
she
wa
small
enough
to
get
through
the
door
she
ran
out
of
the
house
and
found
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animal
and
bird
waiting
outside
the
poor
little
lizard
bill
wa
in
the
middle
being
held
up
by
two
guinea-pigs
who
were
giving
it
something
out
of
a
bottle
they
all
made
a
rush
at
alice
the
moment
she
appeared
but
she
ran
off
a
hard
a
she
could
and
soon
found
herself
safe
in
a
thick
wood
`the
first
thing
i
've
got
to
do
said
alice
to
herself
a
she
wandered
about
in
the
wood
`is
to
grow
to
my
right
size
again
and
the
second
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
lovely
garden
i
think
that
will
be
the
best
plan
it
sounded
an
excellent
plan
no
doubt
and
very
neatly
and
simply
arranged
the
only
difficulty
wa
that
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
set
about
it
and
while
she
wa
peering
about
anxiously
among
the
tree
a
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
a
great
hurry
an
enormous
puppy
wa
looking
down
at
her
with
large
round
eye
and
feebly
stretching
out
one
paw
trying
to
touch
her
`poor
little
thing
said
alice
in
a
coaxing
tone
and
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
it
but
she
wa
terribly
frightened
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
be
hungry
in
which
case
it
would
be
very
likely
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
her
coaxing
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
she
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
stick
and
held
it
out
to
the
puppy
whereupon
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air
off
all
it
foot
at
once
with
a
yelp
of
delight
and
rushed
at
the
stick
and
made
believe
to
worry
it
then
alice
dodged
behind
a
great
thistle
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
over
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
other
side
the
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
stick
and
tumbled
head
over
heel
in
it
hurry
to
get
hold
of
it
then
alice
thinking
it
wa
very
like
having
a
game
of
play
with
a
cart-horse
and
expecting
every
moment
to
be
trampled
under
it
foot
ran
round
the
thistle
again
then
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charge
at
the
stick
running
a
very
little
way
forward
each
time
and
a
long
way
back
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
while
till
at
last
it
sat
down
a
good
way
off
panting
with
it
tongue
hanging
out
of
it
mouth
and
it
great
eye
half
shut
this
seemed
to
alice
a
good
opportunity
for
making
her
escape
so
she
set
off
at
once
and
ran
till
she
wa
quite
tired
and
out
of
breath
and
till
the
puppy
's
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
distance
`and
yet
what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
wa
said
alice
a
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
herself
and
fanned
herself
with
one
of
the
leaf
`i
should
have
liked
teaching
it
trick
very
much
if
--
if
i
'd
only
been
the
right
size
to
do
it
oh
dear
i
'd
nearly
forgotten
that
i
've
got
to
grow
up
again
let
me
see
--
how
is
it
to
be
managed
i
suppose
i
ought
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other
but
the
great
question
is
what
the
great
question
certainly
wa
what
alice
looked
all
round
her
at
the
flower
and
the
blade
of
grass
but
she
did
not
see
anything
that
looked
like
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
circumstance
there
wa
a
large
mushroom
growing
near
her
about
the
same
height
a
herself
and
when
she
had
looked
under
it
and
on
both
side
of
it
and
behind
it
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
a
well
look
and
see
what
wa
on
the
top
of
it
she
stretched
herself
up
on
tiptoe
and
peeped
over
the
edge
of
the
mushroom
and
her
eye
immediately
met
those
of
a
large
caterpillar
that
wa
sitting
on
the
top
with
it
arm
folded
quietly
smoking
a
long
hookah
and
taking
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
or
of
anything
else
chapter
v
advice
from
a
caterpillar
the
caterpillar
and
alice
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
silence
at
last
the
caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
it
mouth
and
addressed
her
in
a
languid
sleepy
voice
`who
are
you
said
the
caterpillar
this
wa
not
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
conversation
alice
replied
rather
shyly
`i
--
i
hardly
know
sir
just
at
present
--
at
least
i
know
who
i
wa
when
i
got
up
this
morning
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
changed
several
time
since
then
`what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
the
caterpillar
sternly
`explain
yourself
`i
ca
n't
explain
myself
i
'm
afraid
sir
said
alice
`because
i
'm
not
myself
you
see
`i
do
n't
see
said
the
caterpillar
`i
'm
afraid
i
ca
n't
put
it
more
clearly
alice
replied
very
politely
`for
i
ca
n't
understand
it
myself
to
begin
with
and
being
so
many
different
size
in
a
day
is
very
confusing
`it
is
n't
said
the
caterpillar
`well
perhaps
you
have
n't
found
it
so
yet
said
alice
`but
when
you
have
to
turn
into
a
chrysalis
--
you
will
some
day
you
know
--
and
then
after
that
into
a
butterfly
i
should
think
you'll
feel
it
a
little
queer
wo
n't
you
`not
a
bit
said
the
caterpillar
`well
perhaps
your
feeling
may
be
different
said
alice
`all
i
know
is
it
would
feel
very
queer
to
me
`you
said
the
caterpillar
contemptuously
`who
are
you
which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
alice
felt
a
little
irritated
at
the
caterpillar's
making
such
very
short
remark
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
said
very
gravely
`i
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
are
first
`why
said
the
caterpillar
here
wa
another
puzzling
question
and
a
alice
could
not
think
of
any
good
reason
and
a
the
caterpillar
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
unpleasant
state
of
mind
she
turned
away
`come
back
the
caterpillar
called
after
her
`i
've
something
important
to
say
this
sounded
promising
certainly
alice
turned
and
came
back
again
`keep
your
temper
said
the
caterpillar
`is
that
all
said
alice
swallowing
down
her
anger
a
well
a
she
could
`no
said
the
caterpillar
alice
thought
she
might
a
well
wait
a
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
perhaps
after
all
it
might
tell
her
something
worth
hearing
for
some
minute
it
puffed
away
without
speaking
but
at
last
it
unfolded
it
arm
took
the
hookah
out
of
it
mouth
again
and
said
`so
you
think
you
're
changed
do
you
`i
'm
afraid
i
am
sir
said
alice
`i
ca
n't
remember
thing
a
i
used
--
and
i
do
n't
keep
the
same
size
for
ten
minute
together
`ca
n't
remember
what
thing
said
the
caterpillar
`well
i
've
tried
to
say
``
how
doth
the
little
busy
bee
''
but
it
all
came
different
alice
replied
in
a
very
melancholy
voice
`repeat
``
you
are
old
father
william
''
said
the
caterpillar
alice
folded
her
hand
and
began
--
`you
are
old
father
william
the
young
man
said
`and
your
hair
ha
become
very
white
and
yet
you
incessantly
stand
on
your
head
--
do
you
think
at
your
age
it
is
right
`in
my
youth
father
william
replied
to
his
son
`i
feared
it
might
injure
the
brain
but
now
that
i
'm
perfectly
sure
i
have
none
why
i
do
it
again
and
again
`you
are
old
said
the
youth
`as
i
mentioned
before
and
have
grown
most
uncommonly
fat
yet
you
turned
a
back-somersault
in
at
the
door
--
pray
what
is
the
reason
of
that
`in
my
youth
said
the
sage
a
he
shook
his
grey
lock
`i
kept
all
my
limb
very
supple
by
the
use
of
this
ointment
--
one
shilling
the
box
--
allow
me
to
sell
you
a
couple
`you
are
old
said
the
youth
`and
your
jaw
are
too
weak
for
anything
tougher
than
suet
yet
you
finished
the
goose
with
the
bone
and
the
beak
--
pray
how
did
you
manage
to
do
it
`in
my
youth
said
his
father
`i
took
to
the
law
and
argued
each
case
with
my
wife
and
the
muscular
strength
which
it
gave
to
my
jaw
ha
lasted
the
rest
of
my
life
`you
are
old
said
the
youth
`one
would
hardly
suppose
that
your
eye
wa
a
steady
a
ever
yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
end
of
your
nose
--
what
made
you
so
awfully
clever
`i
have
answered
three
question
and
that
is
enough
said
his
father
`do
n't
give
yourself
air
do
you
think
i
can
listen
all
day
to
such
stuff
be
off
or
i
'll
kick
you
down
stair
`that
is
not
said
right
said
the
caterpillar
`not
quite
right
i
'm
afraid
said
alice
timidly
`some
of
the
word
have
got
altered
`it
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
said
the
caterpillar
decidedly
and
there
wa
silence
for
some
minute
the
caterpillar
wa
the
first
to
speak
`what
size
do
you
want
to
be
it
asked
`oh
i
'm
not
particular
a
to
size
alice
hastily
replied
`only
one
doe
n't
like
changing
so
often
you
know
`i
do
n't
know
said
the
caterpillar
alice
said
nothing
she
had
never
been
so
much
contradicted
in
her
life
before
and
she
felt
that
she
wa
losing
her
temper
`are
you
content
now
said
the
caterpillar
`well
i
should
like
to
be
a
little
larger
sir
if
you
would
n't
mind
said
alice
`three
inch
is
such
a
wretched
height
to
be
`it
is
a
very
good
height
indeed
said
the
caterpillar
angrily
rearing
itself
upright
a
it
spoke
it
wa
exactly
three
inch
high
`but
i
'm
not
used
to
it
pleaded
poor
alice
in
a
piteous
tone
and
she
thought
of
herself
`i
wish
the
creature
would
n't
be
so
easily
offended
`you
'll
get
used
to
it
in
time
said
the
caterpillar
and
it
put
the
hookah
into
it
mouth
and
began
smoking
again
this
time
alice
waited
patiently
until
it
chose
to
speak
again
in
a
minute
or
two
the
caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
it
mouth
and
yawned
once
or
twice
and
shook
itself
then
it
got
down
off
the
mushroom
and
crawled
away
in
the
grass
merely
remarking
a
it
went
`one
side
will
make
you
grow
taller
and
the
other
side
will
make
you
grow
shorter
`one
side
of
what
the
other
side
of
what
thought
alice
to
herself
`of
the
mushroom
said
the
caterpillar
just
a
if
she
had
asked
it
aloud
and
in
another
moment
it
wa
out
of
sight
alice
remained
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
mushroom
for
a
minute
trying
to
make
out
which
were
the
two
side
of
it
and
a
it
wa
perfectly
round
she
found
this
a
very
difficult
question
however
at
last
she
stretched
her
arm
round
it
a
far
a
they
would
go
and
broke
off
a
bit
of
the
edge
with
each
hand
`and
now
which
is
which
she
said
to
herself
and
nibbled
a
little
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
try
the
effect
the
next
moment
she
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin
it
had
struck
her
foot
she
wa
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
very
sudden
change
but
she
felt
that
there
wa
no
time
to
be
lost
a
she
wa
shrinking
rapidly
so
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
eat
some
of
the
other
bit
her
chin
wa
pressed
so
closely
against
her
foot
that
there
wa
hardly
room
to
open
her
mouth
but
she
did
it
at
last
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
lefthand
bit
`come
my
head
's
free
at
last
said
alice
in
a
tone
of
delight
which
changed
into
alarm
in
another
moment
when
she
found
that
her
shoulder
were
nowhere
to
be
found
all
she
could
see
when
she
looked
down
wa
an
immense
length
of
neck
which
seemed
to
rise
like
a
stalk
out
of
a
sea
of
green
leaf
that
lay
far
below
her
`what
can
all
that
green
stuff
be
said
alice
`and
where
have
my
shoulder
got
to
and
oh
my
poor
hand
how
is
it
i
ca
n't
see
you
she
wa
moving
them
about
a
she
spoke
but
no
result
seemed
to
follow
except
a
little
shaking
among
the
distant
green
leaf
a
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
getting
her
hand
up
to
her
head
she
tried
to
get
her
head
down
to
them
and
wa
delighted
to
find
that
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction
like
a
serpent
she
had
just
succeeded
in
curving
it
down
into
a
graceful
zigzag
and
wa
going
to
dive
in
among
the
leaf
which
she
found
to
be
nothing
but
the
top
of
the
tree
under
which
she
had
been
wandering
when
a
sharp
hiss
made
her
draw
back
in
a
hurry
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
face
and
wa
beating
her
violently
with
it
wing
`serpent
screamed
the
pigeon
`i
'm
not
a
serpent
said
alice
indignantly
`let
me
alone
`serpent
i
say
again
repeated
the
pigeon
but
in
a
more
subdued
tone
and
added
with
a
kind
of
sob
`i
've
tried
every
way
and
nothing
seems
to
suit
them
`i
have
n't
the
least
idea
what
you
're
talking
about
said
alice
`i
've
tried
the
root
of
tree
and
i
've
tried
bank
and
i've
tried
hedge
the
pigeon
went
on
without
attending
to
her
`but
those
serpent
there
's
no
pleasing
them
alice
wa
more
and
more
puzzled
but
she
thought
there
wa
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
pigeon
had
finished
`as
if
it
wa
n't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
egg
said
the
pigeon
`but
i
must
be
on
the
look-out
for
serpent
night
and
day
why
i
have
n't
had
a
wink
of
sleep
these
three
week
`i
'm
very
sorry
you
've
been
annoyed
said
alice
who
wa
beginning
to
see
it
meaning
`and
just
a
i
'd
taken
the
highest
tree
in
the
wood
continued
the
pigeon
raising
it
voice
to
a
shriek
`and
just
a
i
wa
thinking
i
should
be
free
of
them
at
last
they
must
need
come
wriggling
down
from
the
sky
ugh
serpent
`but
i
'm
not
a
serpent
i
tell
you
said
alice
`i
'm
a
--
i'm
a
--
`well
what
are
you
said
the
pigeon
`i
can
see
you're
trying
to
invent
something
`i
--
i
'm
a
little
girl
said
alice
rather
doubtfully
a
she
remembered
the
number
of
change
she
had
gone
through
that
day
`a
likely
story
indeed
said
the
pigeon
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
contempt
`i
've
seen
a
good
many
little
girl
in
my
time
but
never
one
with
such
a
neck
a
that
no
no
you
're
a
serpent
and
there
's
no
use
denying
it
i
suppose
you
'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
never
tasted
an
egg
`i
have
tasted
egg
certainly
said
alice
who
wa
a
very
truthful
child
`but
little
girl
eat
egg
quite
a
much
a
serpent
do
you
know
`i
do
n't
believe
it
said
the
pigeon
`but
if
they
do
why
then
they
're
a
kind
of
serpent
that
's
all
i
can
say
this
wa
such
a
new
idea
to
alice
that
she
wa
quite
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
which
gave
the
pigeon
the
opportunity
of
adding
`you
're
looking
for
egg
i
know
that
well
enough
and
what
doe
it
matter
to
me
whether
you
're
a
little
girl
or
a
serpent
`it
matter
a
good
deal
to
me
said
alice
hastily
`but
i'm
not
looking
for
egg
a
it
happens
and
if
i
wa
i
shouldn't
want
yours
i
do
n't
like
them
raw
`well
be
off
then
said
the
pigeon
in
a
sulky
tone
a
it
settled
down
again
into
it
nest
alice
crouched
down
among
the
tree
a
well
a
she
could
for
her
neck
kept
getting
entangled
among
the
branch
and
every
now
and
then
she
had
to
stop
and
untwist
it
after
a
while
she
remembered
that
she
still
held
the
piece
of
mushroom
in
her
hand
and
she
set
to
work
very
carefully
nibbling
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
shorter
until
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
herself
down
to
her
usual
height
it
wa
so
long
since
she
had
been
anything
near
the
right
size
that
it
felt
quite
strange
at
first
but
she
got
used
to
it
in
a
few
minute
and
began
talking
to
herself
a
usual
`come
there
's
half
my
plan
done
now
how
puzzling
all
these
change
are
i
'm
never
sure
what
i
'm
going
to
be
from
one
minute
to
another
however
i
've
got
back
to
my
right
size
the
next
thing
is
to
get
into
that
beautiful
garden
--
how
is
that
to
be
done
i
wonder
a
she
said
this
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place
with
a
little
house
in
it
about
four
foot
high
`whoever
life
there
thought
alice
`it
'll
never
do
to
come
upon
them
this
size
why
i
should
frighten
them
out
of
their
wit
so
she
began
nibbling
at
the
righthand
bit
again
and
did
not
venture
to
go
near
the
house
till
she
had
brought
herself
down
to
nine
inch
high
chapter
vi
pig
and
pepper
for
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
looking
at
the
house
and
wondering
what
to
do
next
when
suddenly
a
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
the
wood
--
she
considered
him
to
be
a
footman
because
he
wa
in
livery
otherwise
judging
by
his
face
only
she
would
have
called
him
a
fish
--
and
rapped
loudly
at
the
door
with
his
knuckle
it
wa
opened
by
another
footman
in
livery
with
a
round
face
and
large
eye
like
a
frog
and
both
footman
alice
noticed
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
their
head
she
felt
very
curious
to
know
what
it
wa
all
about
and
crept
a
little
way
out
of
the
wood
to
listen
the
fish-footman
began
by
producing
from
under
his
arm
a
great
letter
nearly
a
large
a
himself
and
this
he
handed
over
to
the
other
saying
in
a
solemn
tone
`for
the
duchess
an
invitation
from
the
queen
to
play
croquet
the
frog-footman
repeated
in
the
same
solemn
tone
only
changing
the
order
of
the
word
a
little
`from
the
queen
an
invitation
for
the
duchess
to
play
croquet
then
they
both
bowed
low
and
their
curl
got
entangled
together
alice
laughed
so
much
at
this
that
she
had
to
run
back
into
the
wood
for
fear
of
their
hearing
her
and
when
she
next
peeped
out
the
fish-footman
wa
gone
and
the
other
wa
sitting
on
the
ground
near
the
door
staring
stupidly
up
into
the
sky
alice
went
timidly
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
`there
's
no
sort
of
use
in
knocking
said
the
footman
`and
that
for
two
reason
first
because
i
'm
on
the
same
side
of
the
door
a
you
are
secondly
because
they
're
making
such
a
noise
inside
no
one
could
possibly
hear
you
and
certainly
there
wa
a
most
extraordinary
noise
going
on
within
--
a
constant
howling
and
sneezing
and
every
now
and
then
a
great
crash
a
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
broken
to
piece
`please
then
said
alice
`how
am
i
to
get
in
`there
might
be
some
sense
in
your
knocking
the
footman
went
on
without
attending
to
her
`if
we
had
the
door
between
u
for
instance
if
you
were
inside
you
might
knock
and
i
could
let
you
out
you
know
he
wa
looking
up
into
the
sky
all
the
time
he
wa
speaking
and
this
alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil
`but
perhaps
he
ca
n't
help
it
she
said
to
herself
`his
eye
are
so
very
nearly
at
the
top
of
his
head
but
at
any
rate
he
might
answer
questions.
--
how
am
i
to
get
in
she
repeated
aloud
`i
shall
sit
here
the
footman
remarked
`till
tomorrow
--
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
a
large
plate
came
skimming
out
straight
at
the
footman
's
head
it
just
grazed
his
nose
and
broke
to
piece
against
one
of
the
tree
behind
him
--
or
next
day
maybe
the
footman
continued
in
the
same
tone
exactly
a
if
nothing
had
happened
`how
am
i
to
get
in
asked
alice
again
in
a
louder
tone
`are
you
to
get
in
at
all
said
the
footman
`that
's
the
first
question
you
know
it
wa
no
doubt
only
alice
did
not
like
to
be
told
so
`it
's
really
dreadful
she
muttered
to
herself
`the
way
all
the
creature
argue
it
's
enough
to
drive
one
crazy
the
footman
seemed
to
think
this
a
good
opportunity
for
repeating
his
remark
with
variation
`i
shall
sit
here
he
said
`on
and
off
for
day
and
day
`but
what
am
i
to
do
said
alice
`anything
you
like
said
the
footman
and
began
whistling
`oh
there
's
no
use
in
talking
to
him
said
alice
desperately
`he
's
perfectly
idiotic
and
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
door
led
right
into
a
large
kitchen
which
wa
full
of
smoke
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
duchess
wa
sitting
on
a
three-legged
stool
in
the
middle
nursing
a
baby
the
cook
wa
leaning
over
the
fire
stirring
a
large
cauldron
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
soup
`there
's
certainly
too
much
pepper
in
that
soup
alice
said
to
herself
a
well
a
she
could
for
sneezing
there
wa
certainly
too
much
of
it
in
the
air
even
the
duchess
sneezed
occasionally
and
a
for
the
baby
it
wa
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
moment
's
pause
the
only
thing
in
the
kitchen
that
did
not
sneeze
were
the
cook
and
a
large
cat
which
wa
sitting
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
`please
would
you
tell
me
said
alice
a
little
timidly
for
she
wa
not
quite
sure
whether
it
wa
good
manner
for
her
to
speak
first
`why
your
cat
grin
like
that
`it
's
a
cheshire
cat
said
the
duchess
`and
that
's
why
pig
she
said
the
last
word
with
such
sudden
violence
that
alice
quite
jumped
but
she
saw
in
another
moment
that
it
wa
addressed
to
the
baby
and
not
to
her
so
she
took
courage
and
went
on
again
--
`i
did
n't
know
that
cheshire
cat
always
grinned
in
fact
i
did
n't
know
that
cat
could
grin
`they
all
can
said
the
duchess
`and
most
of
'em
do
`i
do
n't
know
of
any
that
do
alice
said
very
politely
feeling
quite
pleased
to
have
got
into
a
conversation
`you
do
n't
know
much
said
the
duchess
`and
that
's
a
fact
alice
did
not
at
all
like
the
tone
of
this
remark
and
thought
it
would
be
a
well
to
introduce
some
other
subject
of
conversation
while
she
wa
trying
to
fix
on
one
the
cook
took
the
cauldron
of
soup
off
the
fire
and
at
once
set
to
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
the
duchess
and
the
baby
--
the
fire-irons
came
first
then
followed
a
shower
of
saucepan
plate
and
dish
the
duchess
took
no
notice
of
them
even
when
they
hit
her
and
the
baby
wa
howling
so
much
already
that
it
wa
quite
impossible
to
say
whether
the
blow
hurt
it
or
not
`oh
please
mind
what
you
're
doing
cried
alice
jumping
up
and
down
in
an
agony
of
terror
`oh
there
go
his
precious
nose
a
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
it
and
very
nearly
carried
it
off
`if
everybody
minded
their
own
business
the
duchess
said
in
a
hoarse
growl
`the
world
would
go
round
a
deal
faster
than
it
doe
`which
would
not
be
an
advantage
said
alice
who
felt
very
glad
to
get
an
opportunity
of
showing
off
a
little
of
her
knowledge
`just
think
of
what
work
it
would
make
with
the
day
and
night
you
see
the
earth
take
twenty-four
hour
to
turn
round
on
it
axis
--
`talking
of
ax
said
the
duchess
`chop
off
her
head
alice
glanced
rather
anxiously
at
the
cook
to
see
if
she
meant
to
take
the
hint
but
the
cook
wa
busily
stirring
the
soup
and
seemed
not
to
be
listening
so
she
went
on
again
`twenty-four
hour
i
think
or
is
it
twelve
i
--
`oh
do
n't
bother
me
said
the
duchess
`i
never
could
abide
figure
and
with
that
she
began
nursing
her
child
again
singing
a
sort
of
lullaby
to
it
a
she
did
so
and
giving
it
a
violent
shake
at
the
end
of
every
line
`speak
roughly
to
your
little
boy
and
beat
him
when
he
sneeze
he
only
doe
it
to
annoy
because
he
know
it
tease
chorus
in
which
the
cook
and
the
baby
joined
--
`wow
wow
wow
while
the
duchess
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
song
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
violently
up
and
down
and
the
poor
little
thing
howled
so
that
alice
could
hardly
hear
the
word
--
`i
speak
severely
to
my
boy
i
beat
him
when
he
sneeze
for
he
can
thoroughly
enjoy
the
pepper
when
he
plea
chorus
`wow
wow
wow
`here
you
may
nurse
it
a
bit
if
you
like
the
duchess
said
to
alice
flinging
the
baby
at
her
a
she
spoke
`i
must
go
and
get
ready
to
play
croquet
with
the
queen
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
the
cook
threw
a
frying-pan
after
her
a
she
went
out
but
it
just
missed
her
alice
caught
the
baby
with
some
difficulty
a
it
wa
a
queer-
shaped
little
creature
and
held
out
it
arm
and
leg
in
all
direction
`just
like
a
star-fish
thought
alice
the
poor
little
thing
wa
snorting
like
a
steam-engine
when
she
caught
it
and
kept
doubling
itself
up
and
straightening
itself
out
again
so
that
altogether
for
the
first
minute
or
two
it
wa
a
much
a
she
could
do
to
hold
it
a
soon
a
she
had
made
out
the
proper
way
of
nursing
it
which
wa
to
twist
it
up
into
a
sort
of
knot
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
it
right
ear
and
left
foot
so
a
to
prevent
it
undoing
itself
she
carried
it
out
into
the
open
air
`if
i
do
n't
take
this
child
away
with
me
thought
alice
`they
're
sure
to
kill
it
in
a
day
or
two
would
n't
it
be
murder
to
leave
it
behind
she
said
the
last
word
out
loud
and
the
little
thing
grunted
in
reply
it
had
left
off
sneezing
by
this
time
`don't
grunt
said
alice
`that
's
not
at
all
a
proper
way
of
expressing
yourself
the
baby
grunted
again
and
alice
looked
very
anxiously
into
it
face
to
see
what
wa
the
matter
with
it
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
had
a
very
turn-up
nose
much
more
like
a
snout
than
a
real
nose
also
it
eye
were
getting
extremely
small
for
a
baby
altogether
alice
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
thing
at
all
`but
perhaps
it
wa
only
sobbing
she
thought
and
looked
into
it
eye
again
to
see
if
there
were
any
tear
no
there
were
no
tear
`if
you
're
going
to
turn
into
a
pig
my
dear
said
alice
seriously
`i
'll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
mind
now
the
poor
little
thing
sobbed
again
or
grunted
it
wa
impossible
to
say
which
and
they
went
on
for
some
while
in
silence
alice
wa
just
beginning
to
think
to
herself
`now
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
creature
when
i
get
it
home
when
it
grunted
again
so
violently
that
she
looked
down
into
it
face
in
some
alarm
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
it
wa
neither
more
nor
le
than
a
pig
and
she
felt
that
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
carry
it
further
so
she
set
the
little
creature
down
and
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
wood
`if
it
had
grown
up
she
said
to
herself
`it
would
have
made
a
dreadfully
ugly
child
but
it
make
rather
a
handsome
pig
i
think
and
she
began
thinking
over
other
child
she
knew
who
might
do
very
well
a
pig
and
wa
just
saying
to
herself
`if
one
only
knew
the
right
way
to
change
them
--
when
she
wa
a
little
startled
by
seeing
the
cheshire
cat
sitting
on
a
bough
of
a
tree
a
few
yard
off
the
cat
only
grinned
when
it
saw
alice
it
looked
good-
natured
she
thought
still
it
had
very
long
claw
and
a
great
many
teeth
so
she
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
with
respect
`cheshire
pus
she
began
rather
timidly
a
she
did
not
at
all
know
whether
it
would
like
the
name
however
it
only
grinned
a
little
wider
`come
it
's
pleased
so
far
thought
alice
and
she
went
on
`would
you
tell
me
please
which
way
i
ought
to
go
from
here
`that
depends
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
to
said
the
cat
`i
do
n't
much
care
where
--
said
alice
`then
it
doe
n't
matter
which
way
you
go
said
the
cat
--
so
long
a
i
get
somewhere
alice
added
a
an
explanation
`oh
you
're
sure
to
do
that
said
the
cat
`if
you
only
walk
long
enough
alice
felt
that
this
could
not
be
denied
so
she
tried
another
question
`what
sort
of
people
live
about
here
`in
that
direction
the
cat
said
waving
it
right
paw
round
`lives
a
hatter
and
in
that
direction
waving
the
other
paw
`lives
a
march
hare
visit
either
you
like
they
're
both
mad
`but
i
do
n't
want
to
go
among
mad
people
alice
remarked
`oh
you
ca
n't
help
that
said
the
cat
`we
're
all
mad
here
i
'm
mad
you
're
mad
`how
do
you
know
i
'm
mad
said
alice
`you
must
be
said
the
cat
`or
you
would
n't
have
come
here
alice
did
n't
think
that
proved
it
at
all
however
she
went
on
`and
how
do
you
know
that
you
're
mad
`to
begin
with
said
the
cat
`a
dog
's
not
mad
you
grant
that
`i
suppose
so
said
alice
`well
then
the
cat
went
on
`you
see
a
dog
growl
when
it's
angry
and
wag
it
tail
when
it
's
pleased
now
i
growl
when
i'm
pleased
and
wag
my
tail
when
i
'm
angry
therefore
i
'm
mad
`i
call
it
purring
not
growling
said
alice
`call
it
what
you
like
said
the
cat
`do
you
play
croquet
with
the
queen
to-day
`i
should
like
it
very
much
said
alice
`but
i
have
n't
been
invited
yet
`you
'll
see
me
there
said
the
cat
and
vanished
alice
wa
not
much
surprised
at
this
she
wa
getting
so
used
to
queer
thing
happening
while
she
wa
looking
at
the
place
where
it
had
been
it
suddenly
appeared
again
`by-the-bye
what
became
of
the
baby
said
the
cat
`i'd
nearly
forgotten
to
ask
`it
turned
into
a
pig
alice
quietly
said
just
a
if
it
had
come
back
in
a
natural
way
`i
thought
it
would
said
the
cat
and
vanished
again
alice
waited
a
little
half
expecting
to
see
it
again
but
it
did
not
appear
and
after
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
on
in
the
direction
in
which
the
march
hare
wa
said
to
live
`i
've
seen
hatter
before
she
said
to
herself
`the
march
hare
will
be
much
the
most
interesting
and
perhaps
a
this
is
may
it
wo
n't
be
raving
mad
--
at
least
not
so
mad
a
it
wa
in
march
a
she
said
this
she
looked
up
and
there
wa
the
cat
again
sitting
on
a
branch
of
a
tree
`did
you
say
pig
or
fig
said
the
cat
`i
said
pig
replied
alice
`and
i
wish
you
would
n't
keep
appearing
and
vanishing
so
suddenly
you
make
one
quite
giddy
`all
right
said
the
cat
and
this
time
it
vanished
quite
slowly
beginning
with
the
end
of
the
tail
and
ending
with
the
grin
which
remained
some
time
after
the
rest
of
it
had
gone
`well
i
've
often
seen
a
cat
without
a
grin
thought
alice
`but
a
grin
without
a
cat
it
's
the
most
curious
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
she
had
not
gone
much
farther
before
she
came
in
sight
of
the
house
of
the
march
hare
she
thought
it
must
be
the
right
house
because
the
chimney
were
shaped
like
ear
and
the
roof
wa
thatched
with
fur
it
wa
so
large
a
house
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
nearer
till
she
had
nibbled
some
more
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
mushroom
and
raised
herself
to
about
two
foot
high
even
then
she
walked
up
towards
it
rather
timidly
saying
to
herself
`suppose
it
should
be
raving
mad
after
all
i
almost
wish
i'd
gone
to
see
the
hatter
instead
chapter
vii
a
mad
tea-party
there
wa
a
table
set
out
under
a
tree
in
front
of
the
house
and
the
march
hare
and
the
hatter
were
having
tea
at
it
a
dormouse
wa
sitting
between
them
fast
asleep
and
the
other
two
were
using
it
a
a
cushion
resting
their
elbow
on
it
and
talking
over
it
head
`very
uncomfortable
for
the
dormouse
thought
alice
`only
a
it
's
asleep
i
suppose
it
doe
n't
mind
the
table
wa
a
large
one
but
the
three
were
all
crowded
together
at
one
corner
of
it
`no
room
no
room
they
cried
out
when
they
saw
alice
coming
`there
's
plenty
of
room
said
alice
indignantly
and
she
sat
down
in
a
large
arm-chair
at
one
end
of
the
table
`have
some
wine
the
march
hare
said
in
an
encouraging
tone
alice
looked
all
round
the
table
but
there
wa
nothing
on
it
but
tea
`i
do
n't
see
any
wine
she
remarked
`there
is
n't
any
said
the
march
hare
`then
it
wa
n't
very
civil
of
you
to
offer
it
said
alice
angrily
`it
wa
n't
very
civil
of
you
to
sit
down
without
being
invited
said
the
march
hare
`i
did
n't
know
it
wa
your
table
said
alice
`it
's
laid
for
a
great
many
more
than
three
`your
hair
want
cutting
said
the
hatter
he
had
been
looking
at
alice
for
some
time
with
great
curiosity
and
this
wa
his
first
speech
`you
should
learn
not
to
make
personal
remark
alice
said
with
some
severity
`it
's
very
rude
the
hatter
opened
his
eye
very
wide
on
hearing
this
but
all
he
said
wa
`why
is
a
raven
like
a
writing-desk
`come
we
shall
have
some
fun
now
thought
alice
`i
'm
glad
they
've
begun
asking
riddles.
--
i
believe
i
can
guess
that
she
added
aloud
`do
you
mean
that
you
think
you
can
find
out
the
answer
to
it
said
the
march
hare
`exactly
so
said
alice
`then
you
should
say
what
you
mean
the
march
hare
went
on
`i
do
alice
hastily
replied
`at
least
--
at
least
i
mean
what
i
say
--
that
's
the
same
thing
you
know
`not
the
same
thing
a
bit
said
the
hatter
`you
might
just
a
well
say
that
``
i
see
what
i
eat
''
is
the
same
thing
a
``
i
eat
what
i
see
''
`you
might
just
a
well
say
added
the
march
hare
`that
``
i
like
what
i
get
''
is
the
same
thing
a
``
i
get
what
i
like
''
`you
might
just
a
well
say
added
the
dormouse
who
seemed
to
be
talking
in
his
sleep
`that
``
i
breathe
when
i
sleep
''
is
the
same
thing
a
``
i
sleep
when
i
breathe
''
`it
is
the
same
thing
with
you
said
the
hatter
and
here
the
conversation
dropped
and
the
party
sat
silent
for
a
minute
while
alice
thought
over
all
she
could
remember
about
raven
and
writing-desks
which
wa
n't
much
the
hatter
wa
the
first
to
break
the
silence
`what
day
of
the
month
is
it
he
said
turning
to
alice
he
had
taken
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
wa
looking
at
it
uneasily
shaking
it
every
now
and
then
and
holding
it
to
his
ear
alice
considered
a
little
and
then
said
`the
fourth
`two
day
wrong
sighed
the
hatter
`i
told
you
butter
would
n't
suit
the
work
he
added
looking
angrily
at
the
march
hare
`it
wa
the
best
butter
the
march
hare
meekly
replied
`yes
but
some
crumb
must
have
got
in
a
well
the
hatter
grumbled
`you
should
n't
have
put
it
in
with
the
bread-knife
the
march
hare
took
the
watch
and
looked
at
it
gloomily
then
he
dipped
it
into
his
cup
of
tea
and
looked
at
it
again
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
than
his
first
remark
`it
wa
the
best
butter
you
know
alice
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
with
some
curiosity
`what
a
funny
watch
she
remarked
`it
tell
the
day
of
the
month
and
doe
n't
tell
what
o'clock
it
is
`why
should
it
muttered
the
hatter
`does
your
watch
tell
you
what
year
it
is
`of
course
not
alice
replied
very
readily
`but
that's
because
it
stay
the
same
year
for
such
a
long
time
together
`which
is
just
the
case
with
mine
said
the
hatter
alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled
the
hatter
's
remark
seemed
to
have
no
sort
of
meaning
in
it
and
yet
it
wa
certainly
english
`i
do
n't
quite
understand
you
she
said
a
politely
a
she
could
`the
dormouse
is
asleep
again
said
the
hatter
and
he
poured
a
little
hot
tea
upon
it
nose
the
dormouse
shook
it
head
impatiently
and
said
without
opening
it
eye
`of
course
of
course
just
what
i
wa
going
to
remark
myself
`have
you
guessed
the
riddle
yet
the
hatter
said
turning
to
alice
again
`no
i
give
it
up
alice
replied
`what
's
the
answer
`i
have
n't
the
slightest
idea
said
the
hatter
`nor
i
said
the
march
hare
alice
sighed
wearily
`i
think
you
might
do
something
better
with
the
time
she
said
`than
waste
it
in
asking
riddle
that
have
no
answer
`if
you
knew
time
a
well
a
i
do
said
the
hatter
`you
would
n't
talk
about
wasting
it
it
's
him
`i
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
said
alice
`of
course
you
do
n't
the
hatter
said
tossing
his
head
contemptuously
`i
dare
say
you
never
even
spoke
to
time
`perhaps
not
alice
cautiously
replied
`but
i
know
i
have
to
beat
time
when
i
learn
music
`ah
that
account
for
it
said
the
hatter
`he
wo
n't
stand
beating
now
if
you
only
kept
on
good
term
with
him
he
'd
do
almost
anything
you
liked
with
the
clock
for
instance
suppose
it
were
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
just
time
to
begin
lesson
you
'd
only
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
time
and
round
go
the
clock
in
a
twinkling
half-past
one
time
for
dinner
`i
only
wish
it
wa
the
march
hare
said
to
itself
in
a
whisper
`that
would
be
grand
certainly
said
alice
thoughtfully
`but
then
--
i
should
n't
be
hungry
for
it
you
know
`not
at
first
perhaps
said
the
hatter
`but
you
could
keep
it
to
half-past
one
a
long
a
you
liked
`is
that
the
way
you
manage
alice
asked
the
hatter
shook
his
head
mournfully
`not
i
he
replied
`we
quarrelled
last
march
--
just
before
he
went
mad
you
know
--
pointing
with
his
tea
spoon
at
the
march
hare
--
it
wa
at
the
great
concert
given
by
the
queen
of
heart
and
i
had
to
sing
``
twinkle
twinkle
little
bat
how
i
wonder
what
you
're
at
''
you
know
the
song
perhaps
`i
've
heard
something
like
it
said
alice
`it
go
on
you
know
the
hatter
continued
`in
this
way
--
``
up
above
the
world
you
fly
like
a
tea-tray
in
the
sky
twinkle
twinkle
--
''
here
the
dormouse
shook
itself
and
began
singing
in
it
sleep
`twinkle
twinkle
twinkle
twinkle
--
and
went
on
so
long
that
they
had
to
pinch
it
to
make
it
stop
`well
i
'd
hardly
finished
the
first
verse
said
the
hatter
`when
the
queen
jumped
up
and
bawled
out
``
he
's
murdering
the
time
off
with
his
head
''
`how
dreadfully
savage
exclaimed
alice
`and
ever
since
that
the
hatter
went
on
in
a
mournful
tone
`he
wo
n't
do
a
thing
i
ask
it
's
always
six
o'clock
now
a
bright
idea
came
into
alice
's
head
`is
that
the
reason
so
many
tea-things
are
put
out
here
she
asked
`yes
that
's
it
said
the
hatter
with
a
sigh
`it
's
always
tea-time
and
we
've
no
time
to
wash
the
thing
between
while
`then
you
keep
moving
round
i
suppose
said
alice
`exactly
so
said
the
hatter
`as
the
thing
get
used
up
`but
what
happens
when
you
come
to
the
beginning
again
alice
ventured
to
ask
`suppose
we
change
the
subject
the
march
hare
interrupted
yawning
`i
'm
getting
tired
of
this
i
vote
the
young
lady
tell
u
a
story
`i
'm
afraid
i
do
n't
know
one
said
alice
rather
alarmed
at
the
proposal
`then
the
dormouse
shall
they
both
cried
`wake
up
dormouse
and
they
pinched
it
on
both
side
at
once
the
dormouse
slowly
opened
his
eye
`i
wa
n't
asleep
he
said
in
a
hoarse
feeble
voice
`i
heard
every
word
you
fellow
were
saying
`tell
u
a
story
said
the
march
hare
`yes
please
do
pleaded
alice
`and
be
quick
about
it
added
the
hatter
`or
you
'll
be
asleep
again
before
it
's
done
`once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
little
sister
the
dormouse
began
in
a
great
hurry
`and
their
name
were
elsie
lacie
and
tillie
and
they
lived
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
--
`what
did
they
live
on
said
alice
who
always
took
a
great
interest
in
question
of
eating
and
drinking
`they
lived
on
treacle
said
the
dormouse
after
thinking
a
minute
or
two
`they
could
n't
have
done
that
you
know
alice
gently
remarked
`they
'd
have
been
ill.'
`so
they
were
said
the
dormouse
`very
ill.'
alice
tried
to
fancy
to
herself
what
such
an
extraordinary
way
of
living
would
be
like
but
it
puzzled
her
too
much
so
she
went
on
`but
why
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
`take
some
more
tea
the
march
hare
said
to
alice
very
earnestly
`i
've
had
nothing
yet
alice
replied
in
an
offended
tone
`so
i
ca
n't
take
more
`you
mean
you
ca
n't
take
le
said
the
hatter
`it
's
very
easy
to
take
more
than
nothing
`nobody
asked
your
opinion
said
alice
`who
's
making
personal
remark
now
the
hatter
asked
triumphantly
alice
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
to
this
so
she
helped
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter
and
then
turned
to
the
dormouse
and
repeated
her
question
`why
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
the
dormouse
again
took
a
minute
or
two
to
think
about
it
and
then
said
`it
wa
a
treacle-well
`there
's
no
such
thing
alice
wa
beginning
very
angrily
but
the
hatter
and
the
march
hare
went
`sh
sh
and
the
dormouse
sulkily
remarked
`if
you
ca
n't
be
civil
you
'd
better
finish
the
story
for
yourself
`no
please
go
on
alice
said
very
humbly
`i
wo
n't
interrupt
again
i
dare
say
there
may
be
one
`one
indeed
said
the
dormouse
indignantly
however
he
consented
to
go
on
`and
so
these
three
little
sister
--
they
were
learning
to
draw
you
know
--
`what
did
they
draw
said
alice
quite
forgetting
her
promise
`treacle
said
the
dormouse
without
considering
at
all
this
time
`i
want
a
clean
cup
interrupted
the
hatter
`let
's
all
move
one
place
on
he
moved
on
a
he
spoke
and
the
dormouse
followed
him
the
march
hare
moved
into
the
dormouse
's
place
and
alice
rather
unwillingly
took
the
place
of
the
march
hare
the
hatter
wa
the
only
one
who
got
any
advantage
from
the
change
and
alice
wa
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before
a
the
march
hare
had
just
upset
the
milk-jug
into
his
plate
alice
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
dormouse
again
so
she
began
very
cautiously
`but
i
do
n't
understand
where
did
they
draw
the
treacle
from
`you
can
draw
water
out
of
a
water-well
said
the
hatter
`so
i
should
think
you
could
draw
treacle
out
of
a
treacle-well
--
eh
stupid
`but
they
were
in
the
well
alice
said
to
the
dormouse
not
choosing
to
notice
this
last
remark
`of
course
they
were
said
the
dormouse
--
well
in
this
answer
so
confused
poor
alice
that
she
let
the
dormouse
go
on
for
some
time
without
interrupting
it
`they
were
learning
to
draw
the
dormouse
went
on
yawning
and
rubbing
it
eye
for
it
wa
getting
very
sleepy
`and
they
drew
all
manner
of
thing
--

with

said
alice
`why

said
the
march
hare
alice
wa
silent
the
dormouse
had
closed
it
eye
by
this
time
and
wa
going
off
into
a
doze
but
on
being
pinched
by
the
hatter
it
woke
up
again
with
a
little
shriek
and
went
on
--
that
begin
with
an
m
such
a
mouse-traps
and
the
moon
and
memory
and
muchness
--
you

``

''
--
did
you
ever
see
such
a
thing
a
a
drawing
of
a
muchness
`really
now
you
ask
me
said
alice
very
much
confused
`i
do
n't
think
--
`then
you
should
n't
talk
said
the
hatter
this
piece
of
rudeness
wa
more
than
alice
could
bear
she
got
up
in
great
disgust
and
walked
off
the
dormouse
fell
asleep
instantly
and
neither
of
the
others
took
the
least
notice
of
her
going
though
she
looked
back
once
or
twice
half
hoping
that
they
would
call
after
her
the
last
time
she
saw
them
they
were
trying
to
put
the
dormouse
into
the
teapot
`at
any
rate
i
'll
never
go
there
again
said
alice
a
she
picked
her
way
through
the
wood
`it
's
the
stupidest
tea-party
i
ever
wa
at
in
all
my
life
just
a
she
said
this
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
tree
had
a
door
leading
right
into
it
`that
's
very
curious
she
thought
`but
everything
's
curious
today
i
think
i
may
a
well
go
in
at
once
and
in
she
went
once
more
she
found
herself
in
the
long
hall
and
close
to
the
little
glass
table
`now
i
'll
manage
better
this
time
she
said
to
herself
and
began
by
taking
the
little
golden
key
and
unlocking
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
then
she
went
to
work
nibbling
at
the
mushroom
she
had
kept
a
piece
of
it
in
her
pocket
till
she
wa
about
a
foot
high
then
she
walked
down
the
little
passage
and
then
--
she
found
herself
at
last
in
the
beautiful
garden
among
the
bright
flower-beds
and
the
cool
fountain
chapter
viii
the
queen
's
croquet-ground
a
large
rose-tree
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
garden
the
rose
growing
on
it
were
white
but
there
were
three
gardener
at
it
busily
painting
them
red
alice
thought
this
a
very
curious
thing
and
she
went
nearer
to
watch
them
and
just
a
she
came
up
to
them
she
heard
one
of
them
say
`look
out
now
five
do
n't
go
splashing
paint
over
me
like
that
`i
could
n't
help
it
said
five
in
a
sulky
tone
`seven
jogged
my
elbow
on
which
seven
looked
up
and
said
`that
's
right
five
always
lay
the
blame
on
others
`you
'd
better
not
talk
said
five
`i
heard
the
queen
say
only
yesterday
you
deserved
to
be
beheaded
`what
for
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
first
`that
's
none
of
your
business
two
said
seven
`yes
it
is
his
business
said
five
`and
i
'll
tell
him
--
it
wa
for
bringing
the
cook
tulip-roots
instead
of
onion
seven
flung
down
his
brush
and
had
just
begun
`well
of
all
the
unjust
thing
--
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
alice
a
she
stood
watching
them
and
he
checked
himself
suddenly
the
others
looked
round
also
and
all
of
them
bowed
low
`would
you
tell
me
said
alice
a
little
timidly
`why
you
are
painting
those
rose
five
and
seven
said
nothing
but
looked
at
two
two
began
in
a
low
voice
`why
the
fact
is
you
see
miss
this
here
ought
to
have
been
a
red
rose-tree
and
we
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake
and
if
the
queen
wa
to
find
it
out
we
should
all
have
our
head
cut
off
you
know
so
you
see
miss
we
're
doing
our
best
afore
she
come
to
--
at
this
moment
five
who
had
been
anxiously
looking
across
the
garden
called
out
`the
queen
the
queen
and
the
three
gardener
instantly
threw
themselves
flat
upon
their
face
there
wa
a
sound
of
many
footstep
and
alice
looked
round
eager
to
see
the
queen
first
came
ten
soldier
carrying
club
these
were
all
shaped
like
the
three
gardener
oblong
and
flat
with
their
hand
and
foot
at
the
corner
next
the
ten
courtier
these
were
ornamented
all
over
with
diamond
and
walked
two
and
two
a
the
soldier
did
after
these
came
the
royal
child
there
were
ten
of
them
and
the
little
dear
came
jumping
merrily
along
hand
in
hand
in
couple
they
were
all
ornamented
with
heart
next
came
the
guest
mostly
king
and
queen
and
among
them
alice
recognised
the
white
rabbit
it
wa
talking
in
a
hurried
nervous
manner
smiling
at
everything
that
wa
said
and
went
by
without
noticing
her
then
followed
the
knave
of
heart
carrying
the
king
's
crown
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion
and
last
of
all
this
grand
procession
came
the
king
and
queen
of
heart
alice
wa
rather
doubtful
whether
she
ought
not
to
lie
down
on
her
face
like
the
three
gardener
but
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
heard
of
such
a
rule
at
procession
`and
besides
what
would
be
the
use
of
a
procession
thought
she
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
their
face
so
that
they
could
n't
see
it
so
she
stood
still
where
she
wa
and
waited
when
the
procession
came
opposite
to
alice
they
all
stopped
and
looked
at
her
and
the
queen
said
severely
`who
is
this
she
said
it
to
the
knave
of
heart
who
only
bowed
and
smiled
in
reply
`idiot
said
the
queen
tossing
her
head
impatiently
and
turning
to
alice
she
went
on
`what
's
your
name
child
`my
name
is
alice
so
please
your
majesty
said
alice
very
politely
but
she
added
to
herself
`why
they
're
only
a
pack
of
card
after
all
i
need
n't
be
afraid
of
them
`and
who
are
these
said
the
queen
pointing
to
the
three
gardener
who
were
lying
round
the
rosetree
for
you
see
a
they
were
lying
on
their
face
and
the
pattern
on
their
back
wa
the
same
a
the
rest
of
the
pack
she
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
gardener
or
soldier
or
courtier
or
three
of
her
own
child
`how
should
i
know
said
alice
surprised
at
her
own
courage
`it
's
no
business
of
mine
the
queen
turned
crimson
with
fury
and
after
glaring
at
her
for
a
moment
like
a
wild
beast
screamed
`off
with
her
head
off
--
`nonsense
said
alice
very
loudly
and
decidedly
and
the
queen
wa
silent
the
king
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
timidly
said
`consider
my
dear
she
is
only
a
child
the
queen
turned
angrily
away
from
him
and
said
to
the
knave
`turn
them
over
the
knave
did
so
very
carefully
with
one
foot
`get
up
said
the
queen
in
a
shrill
loud
voice
and
the
three
gardener
instantly
jumped
up
and
began
bowing
to
the
king
the
queen
the
royal
child
and
everybody
else
`leave
off
that
screamed
the
queen
`you
make
me
giddy
and
then
turning
to
the
rose-tree
she
went
on
`what
have
you
been
doing
here
`may
it
please
your
majesty
said
two
in
a
very
humble
tone
going
down
on
one
knee
a
he
spoke
`we
were
trying
--
`i
see
said
the
queen
who
had
meanwhile
been
examining
the
rose
`off
with
their
head
and
the
procession
moved
on
three
of
the
soldier
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
unfortunate
gardener
who
ran
to
alice
for
protection
`you
sha
n't
be
beheaded
said
alice
and
she
put
them
into
a
large
flower-pot
that
stood
near
the
three
soldier
wandered
about
for
a
minute
or
two
looking
for
them
and
then
quietly
marched
off
after
the
others
`are
their
head
off
shouted
the
queen
`their
head
are
gone
if
it
please
your
majesty
the
soldier
shouted
in
reply
`that
's
right
shouted
the
queen
`can
you
play
croquet
the
soldier
were
silent
and
looked
at
alice
a
the
question
wa
evidently
meant
for
her
`yes
shouted
alice
`come
on
then
roared
the
queen
and
alice
joined
the
procession
wondering
very
much
what
would
happen
next
`it
's
--
it
's
a
very
fine
day
said
a
timid
voice
at
her
side
she
wa
walking
by
the
white
rabbit
who
wa
peeping
anxiously
into
her
face
`very
said
alice
--
where
's
the
duchess
`hush
hush
said
the
rabbit
in
a
low
hurried
tone
he
looked
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
a
he
spoke
and
then
raised
himself
upon
tiptoe
put
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
and
whispered
`she
's
under
sentence
of
execution
`what
for
said
alice
`did
you
say
``
what
a
pity
''
the
rabbit
asked
`no
i
did
n't
said
alice
`i
do
n't
think
it
's
at
all
a
pity
i
said
``
what
for
''
`she
boxed
the
queen
's
ear
--
the
rabbit
began
alice
gave
a
little
scream
of
laughter
`oh
hush
the
rabbit
whispered
in
a
frightened
tone
`the
queen
will
hear
you
you
see
she
came
rather
late
and
the
queen
said
--
`get
to
your
place
shouted
the
queen
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
people
began
running
about
in
all
direction
tumbling
up
against
each
other
however
they
got
settled
down
in
a
minute
or
two
and
the
game
began
alice
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
life
it
wa
all
ridge
and
furrow
the
ball
were
live
hedgehog
the
mallet
live
flamingo
and
the
soldier
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
to
stand
on
their
hand
and
foot
to
make
the
arch
the
chief
difficulty
alice
found
at
first
wa
in
managing
her
flamingo
she
succeeded
in
getting
it
body
tucked
away
comfortably
enough
under
her
arm
with
it
leg
hanging
down
but
generally
just
a
she
had
got
it
neck
nicely
straightened
out
and
wa
going
to
give
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
it
head
it
would
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
face
with
such
a
puzzled
expression
that
she
could
not
help
bursting
out
laughing
and
when
she
had
got
it
head
down
and
wa
going
to
begin
again
it
wa
very
provoking
to
find
that
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself
and
wa
in
the
act
of
crawling
away
besides
all
this
there
wa
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
to
and
a
the
doubled-up
soldier
were
always
getting
up
and
walking
off
to
other
part
of
the
ground
alice
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
wa
a
very
difficult
game
indeed
the
player
all
played
at
once
without
waiting
for
turn
quarrelling
all
the
while
and
fighting
for
the
hedgehog
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
queen
wa
in
a
furious
passion
and
went
stamping
about
and
shouting
`off
with
his
head
or
`off
with
her
head
about
once
in
a
minute
alice
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
to
be
sure
she
had
not
a
yet
had
any
dispute
with
the
queen
but
she
knew
that
it
might
happen
any
minute
`and
then
thought
she
`what
would
become
of
me
they
're
dreadfully
fond
of
beheading
people
here
the
great
wonder
is
that
there
's
any
one
left
alive
she
wa
looking
about
for
some
way
of
escape
and
wondering
whether
she
could
get
away
without
being
seen
when
she
noticed
a
curious
appearance
in
the
air
it
puzzled
her
very
much
at
first
but
after
watching
it
a
minute
or
two
she
made
it
out
to
be
a
grin
and
she
said
to
herself
`it
's
the
cheshire
cat
now
i
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
to
`how
are
you
getting
on
said
the
cat
a
soon
a
there
wa
mouth
enough
for
it
to
speak
with
alice
waited
till
the
eye
appeared
and
then
nodded
`it
's
no
use
speaking
to
it
she
thought
`till
it
ear
have
come
or
at
least
one
of
them
in
another
minute
the
whole
head
appeared
and
then
alice
put
down
her
flamingo
and
began
an
account
of
the
game
feeling
very
glad
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
her
the
cat
seemed
to
think
that
there
wa
enough
of
it
now
in
sight
and
no
more
of
it
appeared
`i
do
n't
think
they
play
at
all
fairly
alice
began
in
rather
a
complaining
tone
`and
they
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
can't
hear
oneself
speak
--
and
they
do
n't
seem
to
have
any
rule
in
particular
at
least
if
there
are
nobody
attends
to
them
--
and
you
've
no
idea
how
confusing
it
is
all
the
thing
being
alive
for
instance
there
's
the
arch
i
've
got
to
go
through
next
walking
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
ground
--
and
i
should
have
croqueted
the
queen
's
hedgehog
just
now
only
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
mine
coming
`how
do
you
like
the
queen
said
the
cat
in
a
low
voice
`not
at
all
said
alice
`she
's
so
extremely
--
just
then
she
noticed
that
the
queen
wa
close
behind
her
listening
so
she
went
on
--
likely
to
win
that
it
's
hardly
worth
while
finishing
the
game
the
queen
smiled
and
passed
on
`who
are
you
talking
to
said
the
king
going
up
to
alice
and
looking
at
the
cat
's
head
with
great
curiosity
`it
's
a
friend
of
mine
--
a
cheshire
cat
said
alice
`allow
me
to
introduce
it
`i
do
n't
like
the
look
of
it
at
all
said
the
king
`however
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
like
`i
'd
rather
not
the
cat
remarked
`do
n't
be
impertinent
said
the
king
`and
do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
he
got
behind
alice
a
he
spoke
`a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
said
alice
`i
've
read
that
in
some
book
but
i
do
n't
remember
where
`well
it
must
be
removed
said
the
king
very
decidedly
and
he
called
the
queen
who
wa
passing
at
the
moment
`my
dear
i
wish
you
would
have
this
cat
removed
the
queen
had
only
one
way
of
settling
all
difficulty
great
or
small
`off
with
his
head
she
said
without
even
looking
round
`i
'll
fetch
the
executioner
myself
said
the
king
eagerly
and
he
hurried
off
alice
thought
she
might
a
well
go
back
and
see
how
the
game
wa
going
on
a
she
heard
the
queen
's
voice
in
the
distance
screaming
with
passion
she
had
already
heard
her
sentence
three
of
the
player
to
be
executed
for
having
missed
their
turn
and
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
thing
at
all
a
the
game
wa
in
such
confusion
that
she
never
knew
whether
it
wa
her
turn
or
not
so
she
went
in
search
of
her
hedgehog
the
hedgehog
wa
engaged
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog
which
seemed
to
alice
an
excellent
opportunity
for
croqueting
one
of
them
with
the
other
the
only
difficulty
wa
that
her
flamingo
wa
gone
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
garden
where
alice
could
see
it
trying
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
to
fly
up
into
a
tree
by
the
time
she
had
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
back
the
fight
wa
over
and
both
the
hedgehog
were
out
of
sight
`but
it
doe
n't
matter
much
thought
alice
`as
all
the
arch
are
gone
from
this
side
of
the
ground
so
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm
that
it
might
not
escape
again
and
went
back
for
a
little
more
conversation
with
her
friend
when
she
got
back
to
the
cheshire
cat
she
wa
surprised
to
find
quite
a
large
crowd
collected
round
it
there
wa
a
dispute
going
on
between
the
executioner
the
king
and
the
queen
who
were
all
talking
at
once
while
all
the
rest
were
quite
silent
and
looked
very
uncomfortable
the
moment
alice
appeared
she
wa
appealed
to
by
all
three
to
settle
the
question
and
they
repeated
their
argument
to
her
though
a
they
all
spoke
at
once
she
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
out
exactly
what
they
said
the
executioner
's
argument
wa
that
you
could
n't
cut
off
a
head
unless
there
wa
a
body
to
cut
it
off
from
that
he
had
never
had
to
do
such
a
thing
before
and
he
wa
n't
going
to
begin
at
his
time
of
life
the
king
's
argument
wa
that
anything
that
had
a
head
could
be
beheaded
and
that
you
were
n't
to
talk
nonsense
the
queen
's
argument
wa
that
if
something
wa
n't
done
about
it
in
le
than
no
time
she
'd
have
everybody
executed
all
round
it
wa
this
last
remark
that
had
made
the
whole
party
look
so
grave
and
anxious
alice
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
but
`it
belongs
to
the
duchess
you
'd
better
ask
her
about
it
`she
's
in
prison
the
queen
said
to
the
executioner
`fetch
her
here
and
the
executioner
went
off
like
an
arrow
the
cat
's
head
began
fading
away
the
moment
he
wa
gone
and
by
the
time
he
had
come
back
with
the
duchess
it
had
entirely
disappeared
so
the
king
and
the
executioner
ran
wildly
up
and
down
looking
for
it
while
the
rest
of
the
party
went
back
to
the
game
chapter
ix
the
mock
turtle
's
story
`you
ca
n't
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again
you
dear
old
thing
said
the
duchess
a
she
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
alice
's
and
they
walked
off
together
alice
wa
very
glad
to
find
her
in
such
a
pleasant
temper
and
thought
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
wa
only
the
pepper
that
had
made
her
so
savage
when
they
met
in
the
kitchen
`when
i
'm
a
duchess
she
said
to
herself
not
in
a
very
hopeful
tone
though
`i
wo
n't
have
any
pepper
in
my
kitchen
at
all
soup
doe
very
well
without
--
maybe
it
's
always
pepper
that
make
people
hot-tempered
she
went
on
very
much
pleased
at
having
found
out
a
new
kind
of
rule
`and
vinegar
that
make
them
sour
--
and
camomile
that
make
them
bitter
--
and
--
and
barley-sugar
and
such
thing
that
make
child
sweet-tempered
i
only
wish
people
knew
that
then
they
would
n't
be
so
stingy
about
it
you
know
--
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
duchess
by
this
time
and
wa
a
little
startled
when
she
heard
her
voice
close
to
her
ear
`you
're
thinking
about
something
my
dear
and
that
make
you
forget
to
talk
i
ca
n't
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
is
but
i
shall
remember
it
in
a
bit
`perhaps
it
ha
n't
one
alice
ventured
to
remark
`tut
tut
child
said
the
duchess
`everything
's
got
a
moral
if
only
you
can
find
it
and
she
squeezed
herself
up
closer
to
alice
's
side
a
she
spoke
alice
did
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
her
first
because
the
duchess
wa
very
ugly
and
secondly
because
she
wa
exactly
the
right
height
to
rest
her
chin
upon
alice
's
shoulder
and
it
wa
an
uncomfortably
sharp
chin
however
she
did
not
like
to
be
rude
so
she
bore
it
a
well
a
she
could
`the
game
's
going
on
rather
better
now
she
said
by
way
of
keeping
up
the
conversation
a
little
`'tis
so
said
the
duchess
`and
the
moral
of
that
is
--
''
oh
'tis
love
't
is
love
that
make
the
world
go
round
''
`somebody
said
alice
whispered
`that
it
's
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business
`ah
well
it
mean
much
the
same
thing
said
the
duchess
digging
her
sharp
little
chin
into
alice
's
shoulder
a
she
added
`and
the
moral
of
that
is
--
''
take
care
of
the
sense
and
the
sound
will
take
care
of
themselves
''
`how
fond
she
is
of
finding
moral
in
thing
alice
thought
to
herself
`i
dare
say
you
're
wondering
why
i
do
n't
put
my
arm
round
your
waist
the
duchess
said
after
a
pause
`the
reason
is
that
i'm
doubtful
about
the
temper
of
your
flamingo
shall
i
try
the
experiment
`he
might
bite
alice
cautiously
replied
not
feeling
at
all
anxious
to
have
the
experiment
tried
`very
true
said
the
duchess
`flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite
and
the
moral
of
that
is
--
''
bird
of
a
feather
flock
together
''
`only
mustard
is
n't
a
bird
alice
remarked
`right
a
usual
said
the
duchess
`what
a
clear
way
you
have
of
putting
thing
`it
's
a
mineral
i
think
said
alice
`of
course
it
is
said
the
duchess
who
seemed
ready
to
agree
to
everything
that
alice
said
`there
's
a
large
mustard-mine
near
here
and
the
moral
of
that
is
--
''
the
more
there
is
of
mine
the
le
there
is
of
yours
''
`oh
i
know
exclaimed
alice
who
had
not
attended
to
this
last
remark
`it
's
a
vegetable
it
doe
n't
look
like
one
but
it
is
`i
quite
agree
with
you
said
the
duchess
`and
the
moral
of
that
is
--
''
be
what
you
would
seem
to
be
''
--
or
if
you
'd
like
it
put
more
simply
--
''
never
imagine
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
wa
not
otherwise
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
otherwise
''
`i
think
i
should
understand
that
better
alice
said
very
politely
`if
i
had
it
written
down
but
i
ca
n't
quite
follow
it
a
you
say
it
`that
's
nothing
to
what
i
could
say
if
i
chose
the
duchess
replied
in
a
pleased
tone
`pray
do
n't
trouble
yourself
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that
said
alice
`oh
do
n't
talk
about
trouble
said
the
duchess
`i
make
you
a
present
of
everything
i
've
said
a
yet
`a
cheap
sort
of
present
thought
alice
`i
'm
glad
they
don't
give
birthday
present
like
that
but
she
did
not
venture
to
say
it
out
loud
`thinking
again
the
duchess
asked
with
another
dig
of
her
sharp
little
chin
`i
've
a
right
to
think
said
alice
sharply
for
she
wa
beginning
to
feel
a
little
worried
`just
about
a
much
right
said
the
duchess
`as
pig
have
to
fly
and
the
m
--
but
here
to
alice
's
great
surprise
the
duchess
's
voice
died
away
even
in
the
middle
of
her
favourite
word
`moral
and
the
arm
that
wa
linked
into
hers
began
to
tremble
alice
looked
up
and
there
stood
the
queen
in
front
of
them
with
her
arm
folded
frowning
like
a
thunderstorm
`a
fine
day
your
majesty
the
duchess
began
in
a
low
weak
voice
`now
i
give
you
fair
warning
shouted
the
queen
stamping
on
the
ground
a
she
spoke
`either
you
or
your
head
must
be
off
and
that
in
about
half
no
time
take
your
choice
the
duchess
took
her
choice
and
wa
gone
in
a
moment
`let
's
go
on
with
the
game
the
queen
said
to
alice
and
alice
wa
too
much
frightened
to
say
a
word
but
slowly
followed
her
back
to
the
croquet-ground
the
other
guest
had
taken
advantage
of
the
queen
's
absence
and
were
resting
in
the
shade
however
the
moment
they
saw
her
they
hurried
back
to
the
game
the
queen
merely
remarking
that
a
moment
's
delay
would
cost
them
their
life
all
the
time
they
were
playing
the
queen
never
left
off
quarrelling
with
the
other
player
and
shouting
`off
with
his
head
or
`off
with
her
head
those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
soldier
who
of
course
had
to
leave
off
being
arch
to
do
this
so
that
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
arch
left
and
all
the
player
except
the
king
the
queen
and
alice
were
in
custody
and
under
sentence
of
execution
then
the
queen
left
off
quite
out
of
breath
and
said
to
alice
`have
you
seen
the
mock
turtle
yet
`no
said
alice
`i
do
n't
even
know
what
a
mock
turtle
is
`it
's
the
thing
mock
turtle
soup
is
made
from
said
the
queen
`i
never
saw
one
or
heard
of
one
said
alice
`come
on
then
said
the
queen
`and
he
shall
tell
you
his
history
a
they
walked
off
together
alice
heard
the
king
say
in
a
low
voice
to
the
company
generally
`you
are
all
pardoned
`come
that
's
a
good
thing
she
said
to
herself
for
she
had
felt
quite
unhappy
at
the
number
of
execution
the
queen
had
ordered
they
very
soon
came
upon
a
gryphon
lying
fast
asleep
in
the
sun
if
you
do
n't
know
what
a
gryphon
is
look
at
the
picture
`up
lazy
thing
said
the
queen
`and
take
this
young
lady
to
see
the
mock
turtle
and
to
hear
his
history
i
must
go
back
and
see
after
some
execution
i
have
ordered
and
she
walked
off
leaving
alice
alone
with
the
gryphon
alice
did
not
quite
like
the
look
of
the
creature
but
on
the
whole
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
a
safe
to
stay
with
it
a
to
go
after
that
savage
queen
so
she
waited
the
gryphon
sat
up
and
rubbed
it
eye
then
it
watched
the
queen
till
she
wa
out
of
sight
then
it
chuckled
`what
fun
said
the
gryphon
half
to
itself
half
to
alice
`what
is
the
fun
said
alice
`why
she
said
the
gryphon
`it
's
all
her
fancy
that
they
never
executes
nobody
you
know
come
on
`everybody
say
``
come
on
''
here
thought
alice
a
she
went
slowly
after
it
`i
never
wa
so
ordered
about
in
all
my
life
never
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
the
mock
turtle
in
the
distance
sitting
sad
and
lonely
on
a
little
ledge
of
rock
and
a
they
came
nearer
alice
could
hear
him
sighing
a
if
his
heart
would
break
she
pitied
him
deeply
`what
is
his
sorrow
she
asked
the
gryphon
and
the
gryphon
answered
very
nearly
in
the
same
word
a
before
`it
's
all
his
fancy
that
he
ha
n't
got
no
sorrow
you
know
come
on
so
they
went
up
to
the
mock
turtle
who
looked
at
them
with
large
eye
full
of
tear
but
said
nothing
`this
here
young
lady
said
the
gryphon
`she
want
for
to
know
your
history
she
do
`i
'll
tell
it
her
said
the
mock
turtle
in
a
deep
hollow
tone
`sit
down
both
of
you
and
do
n't
speak
a
word
till
i've
finished
so
they
sat
down
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
minute
alice
thought
to
herself
`i
do
n't
see
how
he
can
even
finish
if
he
doe
n't
begin
but
she
waited
patiently
`once
said
the
mock
turtle
at
last
with
a
deep
sigh
`i
wa
a
real
turtle
these
word
were
followed
by
a
very
long
silence
broken
only
by
an
occasional
exclamation
of
`hjckrrh
from
the
gryphon
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
mock
turtle
alice
wa
very
nearly
getting
up
and
saying
`thank
you
sir
for
your
interesting
story
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
there
must
be
more
to
come
so
she
sat
still
and
said
nothing
`when
we
were
little
the
mock
turtle
went
on
at
last
more
calmly
though
still
sobbing
a
little
now
and
then
`we
went
to
school
in
the
sea
the
master
wa
an
old
turtle
--
we
used
to
call
him
tortoise
--
`why
did
you
call
him
tortoise
if
he
wa
n't
one
alice
asked
`we
called
him
tortoise
because
he
taught
u
said
the
mock
turtle
angrily
`really
you
are
very
dull
`you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
asking
such
a
simple
question
added
the
gryphon
and
then
they
both
sat
silent
and
looked
at
poor
alice
who
felt
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
at
last
the
gryphon
said
to
the
mock
turtle
`drive
on
old
fellow
do
n't
be
all
day
about
it
and
he
went
on
in
these
word
`yes
we
went
to
school
in
the
sea
though
you
may
n't
believe
it
--
`i
never
said
i
did
n't
interrupted
alice
`you
did
said
the
mock
turtle
`hold
your
tongue
added
the
gryphon
before
alice
could
speak
again
the
mock
turtle
went
on
`we
had
the
best
of
education
--
in
fact
we
went
to
school
every
day
--
`i
've
been
to
a
day-school
too
said
alice
`you
need
n't
be
so
proud
a
all
that
`with
extra
asked
the
mock
turtle
a
little
anxiously
`yes
said
alice
`we
learned
french
and
music
`and
washing
said
the
mock
turtle
`certainly
not
said
alice
indignantly
`ah
then
yours
wa
n't
a
really
good
school
said
the
mock
turtle
in
a
tone
of
great
relief
`now
at
ours
they
had
at
the
end
of
the
bill
``
french
music
and
washing
--
extra
''
`you
could
n't
have
wanted
it
much
said
alice
`living
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
`i
could
n't
afford
to
learn
it
said
the
mock
turtle
with
a
sigh
`i
only
took
the
regular
course
`what
wa
that
inquired
alice
`reeling
and
writhing
of
course
to
begin
with
the
mock
turtle
replied
`and
then
the
different
branch
of
arithmetic
--
ambition
distraction
uglification
and
derision
`i
never
heard
of
``
uglification
''
alice
ventured
to
say
`what
is
it
the
gryphon
lifted
up
both
it
paw
in
surprise
`what
never
heard
of
uglifying
it
exclaimed
`you
know
what
to
beautify
is
i
suppose
`yes
said
alice
doubtfully
`it
mean
--
to
--
make
--
anything
--
prettier
`well
then
the
gryphon
went
on
`if
you
do
n't
know
what
to
uglify
is
you
are
a
simpleton
alice
did
not
feel
encouraged
to
ask
any
more
question
about
it
so
she
turned
to
the
mock
turtle
and
said
`what
else
had
you
to
learn
`well
there
wa
mystery
the
mock
turtle
replied
counting
off
the
subject
on
his
flapper
--
mystery
ancient
and
modern
with
seaography
then
drawling
--
the
drawling-master
wa
an
old
conger-eel
that
used
to
come
once
a
week
he
taught
u
drawling
stretching
and
fainting
in
coil
`what
wa
that
like
said
alice
`well
i
ca
n't
show
it
you
myself
the
mock
turtle
said
`i'm
too
stiff
and
the
gryphon
never
learnt
it
`had
n't
time
said
the
gryphon
`i
went
to
the
classic
master
though
he
wa
an
old
crab
he
wa
`i
never
went
to
him
the
mock
turtle
said
with
a
sigh
`he
taught
laughing
and
grief
they
used
to
say
`so
he
did
so
he
did
said
the
gryphon
sighing
in
his
turn
and
both
creature
hid
their
face
in
their
paw
`and
how
many
hour
a
day
did
you
do
lesson
said
alice
in
a
hurry
to
change
the
subject
`ten
hour
the
first
day
said
the
mock
turtle
`nine
the
next
and
so
on
`what
a
curious
plan
exclaimed
alice
`that
's
the
reason
they
're
called
lesson
the
gryphon
remarked
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
day
this
wa
quite
a
new
idea
to
alice
and
she
thought
it
over
a
little
before
she
made
her
next
remark
`then
the
eleventh
day
must
have
been
a
holiday
`of
course
it
wa
said
the
mock
turtle
`and
how
did
you
manage
on
the
twelfth
alice
went
on
eagerly
`that
's
enough
about
lesson
the
gryphon
interrupted
in
a
very
decided
tone
`tell
her
something
about
the
game
now
chapter
x
the
lobster
quadrille
the
mock
turtle
sighed
deeply
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eye
he
looked
at
alice
and
tried
to
speak
but
for
a
minute
or
two
sob
choked
his
voice
`same
a
if
he
had
a
bone
in
his
throat
said
the
gryphon
and
it
set
to
work
shaking
him
and
punching
him
in
the
back
at
last
the
mock
turtle
recovered
his
voice
and
with
tear
running
down
his
cheek
he
went
on
again
--
`you
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
sea
--
`i
have
n't
said
alice
--
`and
perhaps
you
were
never
even
introduced
to
a
lobster
--
alice
began
to
say
`i
once
tasted
--
but
checked
herself
hastily
and
said
`no
never
--
so
you
can
have
no
idea
what
a
delightful
thing
a
lobster
quadrille
is
`no
indeed
said
alice
`what
sort
of
a
dance
is
it
`why
said
the
gryphon
`you
first
form
into
a
line
along
the
sea-shore
--
`two
line
cried
the
mock
turtle
`seals
turtle
salmon
and
so
on
then
when
you
've
cleared
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
the
way
--
`that
generally
take
some
time
interrupted
the
gryphon
--
you
advance
twice
--
`each
with
a
lobster
a
a
partner
cried
the
gryphon
`of
course
the
mock
turtle
said
`advance
twice
set
to
partner
--
--
change
lobster
and
retire
in
same
order
continued
the
gryphon
`then
you
know
the
mock
turtle
went
on
`you
throw
the
--
`the
lobster
shouted
the
gryphon
with
a
bound
into
the
air
--
a
far
out
to
sea
a
you
can
--
`swim
after
them
screamed
the
gryphon
`turn
a
somersault
in
the
sea
cried
the
mock
turtle
capering
wildly
about
`change
lobster
again
yelled
the
gryphon
at
the
top
of
it
voice
`back
to
land
again
and
that
's
all
the
first
figure
said
the
mock
turtle
suddenly
dropping
his
voice
and
the
two
creature
who
had
been
jumping
about
like
mad
thing
all
this
time
sat
down
again
very
sadly
and
quietly
and
looked
at
alice
`it
must
be
a
very
pretty
dance
said
alice
timidly
`would
you
like
to
see
a
little
of
it
said
the
mock
turtle
`very
much
indeed
said
alice
`come
let
's
try
the
first
figure
said
the
mock
turtle
to
the
gryphon
`we
can
do
without
lobster
you
know
which
shall
sing
`oh
you
sing
said
the
gryphon
`i
've
forgotten
the
word
so
they
began
solemnly
dancing
round
and
round
alice
every
now
and
then
treading
on
her
toe
when
they
passed
too
close
and
waving
their
forepaw
to
mark
the
time
while
the
mock
turtle
sang
this
very
slowly
and
sadly
--
''
will
you
walk
a
little
faster
''
said
a
whiting
to
a
snail
``
there
's
a
porpoise
close
behind
u
and
he
's
treading
on
my
tail
see
how
eagerly
the
lobster
and
the
turtle
all
advance
they
are
waiting
on
the
shingle
--

lobster
out
to

''
but
the
snail
replied
``
too
far
too
far
''
and
gave
a
look
askance
--
said
he
thanked
the
whiting
kindly
but
he
would
not

''

his
scaly
friend
replied
``

''
`thank
you
it
's
a
very
interesting
dance
to
watch
said
alice
feeling
very
glad
that
it
wa
over
at
last
`and
i
do
so
like
that
curious
song
about
the
whiting
`oh
a
to
the
whiting
said
the
mock
turtle
`they
--
you've
seen
them
of
course
`yes
said
alice
`i
've
often
seen
them
at
dinn
--
she
checked
herself
hastily
`i
do
n't
know
where
dinn
may
be
said
the
mock
turtle
`but
if
you
've
seen
them
so
often
of
course
you
know
what
they're
like
`i
believe
so
alice
replied
thoughtfully
`they
have
their
tail
in
their
mouth
--
and
they
're
all
over
crumb
`you
're
wrong
about
the
crumb
said
the
mock
turtle
`crumbs
would
all
wash
off
in
the
sea
but
they
have
their
tail
in
their
mouth
and
the
reason
is
--
here
the
mock
turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
eyes.
--
`tell
her
about
the
reason
and
all
that
he
said
to
the
gryphon
`the
reason
is
said
the
gryphon
`that
they
would
go
with
the
lobster
to
the
dance
so
they
got
thrown
out
to
sea
so
they
had
to
fall
a
long
way
so
they
got
their
tail
fast
in
their
mouth
so
they
could
n't
get
them
out
again
that
's
all
`thank
you
said
alice
`it
's
very
interesting
i
never
knew
so
much
about
a
whiting
before
`i
can
tell
you
more
than
that
if
you
like
said
the
gryphon
`do
you
know
why
it
's
called
a
whiting
`i
never
thought
about
it
said
alice
`why
`it
doe
the
boot
and
shoe
the
gryphon
replied
very
solemnly
alice
wa
thoroughly
puzzled
`does
the
boot
and
shoe
she
repeated
in
a
wondering
tone
`why
what
are
your
shoe
done
with
said
the
gryphon
`i
mean
what
make
them
so
shiny
alice
looked
down
at
them
and
considered
a
little
before
she
gave
her
answer
`they
're
done
with
blacking
i
believe
`boots
and
shoe
under
the
sea
the
gryphon
went
on
in
a
deep
voice
`are
done
with
a
whiting
now
you
know
`and
what
are
they
made
of
alice
asked
in
a
tone
of
great
curiosity
`soles
and
eel
of
course
the
gryphon
replied
rather
impatiently
`any
shrimp
could
have
told
you
that
`if
i
'd
been
the
whiting
said
alice
whose
thought
were
still
running
on
the
song
`i
'd
have
said
to
the
porpoise
``
keep
back
please
we
do
n't
want
you
with
u
''
`they
were
obliged
to
have
him
with
them
the
mock
turtle
said
`no
wise
fish
would
go
anywhere
without
a
porpoise
`would
n't
it
really
said
alice
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
`of
course
not
said
the
mock
turtle
`why
if
a
fish
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
wa
going
a
journey
i
should
say
``
with
what
porpoise
''
`do
n't
you
mean
``
purpose
''
said
alice
`i
mean
what
i
say
the
mock
turtle
replied
in
an
offended
tone
and
the
gryphon
added
`come
let
's
hear
some
of
your
adventure
`i
could
tell
you
my
adventure
--
beginning
from
this
morning
said
alice
a
little
timidly
`but
it
's
no
use
going
back
to
yesterday
because
i
wa
a
different
person
then
`explain
all
that
said
the
mock
turtle
`no
no
the
adventure
first
said
the
gryphon
in
an
impatient
tone
`explanations
take
such
a
dreadful
time
so
alice
began
telling
them
her
adventure
from
the
time
when
she
first
saw
the
white
rabbit
she
wa
a
little
nervous
about
it
just
at
first
the
two
creature
got
so
close
to
her
one
on
each
side
and
opened
their
eye
and
mouth
so
very
wide
but
she
gained
courage
a
she
went
on
her
listener
were
perfectly
quiet
till
she
got
to
the
part
about
her
repeating
`you
are
old
father
william
to
the
caterpillar
and
the
word
all
coming
different
and
then
the
mock
turtle
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
`that
's
very
curious
`it
's
all
about
a
curious
a
it
can
be
said
the
gryphon
`it
all
came
different
the
mock
turtle
repeated
thoughtfully
`i
should
like
to
hear
her
try
and
repeat
something
now
tell
her
to
begin
he
looked
at
the
gryphon
a
if
he
thought
it
had
some
kind
of
authority
over
alice
`stand
up
and
repeat
``
't
is
the
voice
of
the
sluggard
''
said
the
gryphon
`how
the
creature
order
one
about
and
make
one
repeat
lesson
thought
alice
`i
might
a
well
be
at
school
at
once
however
she
got
up
and
began
to
repeat
it
but
her
head
wa
so
full
of
the
lobster
quadrille
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
wa
saying
and
the
word
came
very
queer
indeed
--
`'tis
the
voice
of
the
lobster
i
heard
him
declare
``
you
have
baked
me
too
brown
i
must
sugar
my
hair
''
a
a
duck
with
it
eyelid
so
he
with
his
nose
trim
his
belt
and
his
button
and
turn
out
his
toe
later
edition
continued
a
follows
when
the
sand
are
all
dry
he
is
gay
a
a
lark
and
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tone
of
the
shark
but
when
the
tide
rise
and
shark
are
around
his
voice
ha
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound
`that
's
different
from
what
i
used
to
say
when
i
wa
a
child
said
the
gryphon
`well
i
never
heard
it
before
said
the
mock
turtle
`but
it
sound
uncommon
nonsense
alice
said
nothing
she
had
sat
down
with
her
face
in
her
hand
wondering
if
anything
would
ever
happen
in
a
natural
way
again
`i
should
like
to
have
it
explained
said
the
mock
turtle
`she
ca
n't
explain
it
said
the
gryphon
hastily
`go
on
with
the
next
verse
`but
about
his
toe
the
mock
turtle
persisted
`how
could
he
turn
them
out
with
his
nose
you
know
`it
's
the
first
position
in
dancing
alice
said
but
wa
dreadfully
puzzled
by
the
whole
thing
and
longed
to
change
the
subject
`go
on
with
the
next
verse
the
gryphon
repeated
impatiently
`it
begin
``
i
passed
by
his
garden
''
alice
did
not
dare
to
disobey
though
she
felt
sure
it
would
all
come
wrong
and
she
went
on
in
a
trembling
voice
--
`i
passed
by
his
garden
and
marked
with
one
eye
how
the
owl
and
the
panther
were
sharing
a
pie
--
later
edition
continued
a
follows
the
panther
took
pie-crust
and
gravy
and
meat
while
the
owl
had
the
dish
a
it
share
of
the
treat
when
the
pie
wa
all
finished
the
owl
a
a
boon
wa
kindly
permitted
to
pocket
the
spoon
while
the
panther
received
knife
and
fork
with
a
growl
and
concluded
the
banquet
--
`what
is
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
stuff
the
mock
turtle
interrupted
`if
you
do
n't
explain
it
a
you
go
on
it
's
by
far
the
most
confusing
thing
i
ever
heard
`yes
i
think
you
'd
better
leave
off
said
the
gryphon
and
alice
wa
only
too
glad
to
do
so
`shall
we
try
another
figure
of
the
lobster
quadrille
the
gryphon
went
on
`or
would
you
like
the
mock
turtle
to
sing
you
a
song
`oh
a
song
please
if
the
mock
turtle
would
be
so
kind
alice
replied
so
eagerly
that
the
gryphon
said
in
a
rather
offended
tone
`hm
no
accounting
for
taste
sing
her
''
turtle
soup
''
will
you
old
fellow
the
mock
turtle
sighed
deeply
and
began
in
a
voice
sometimes
choked
with
sob
to
sing
this
--
`beautiful

rich
and

again
cried
the
gryphon
and
the
mock
turtle
had
just
begun
to
repeat
it
when
a
cry
of
`the
trial
's
beginning
wa
heard
in
the
distance
`come

cried
the
gryphon
and
taking
alice
by
the
hand
it
hurried
off
without
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
song
`what

alice
panted
a
she
ran
but
the
gryphon
only
answered
`come

ran
the
faster

more
and
more
faintly
came

chapter
xi
who
stole
the
tart
the
king
and
queen
of
heart
were
seated
on
their
throne
when
they
arrived
with
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them
--
all
sort
of
little
bird
and
beast
a
well
a
the
whole
pack
of
card
the
knave
wa
standing
before
them
in
chain
with
a
soldier
on
each
side
to
guard
him
and
near
the
king
wa
the
white
rabbit
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand
and
a
scroll
of
parchment
in
the
other
in
the
very
middle
of
the
court
wa
a
table
with
a
large
dish
of
tart
upon
it
they
looked
so
good
that
it
made
alice
quite
hungry
to
look
at
them
--
`i
wish
they
'd
get
the
trial
done
she
thought
`and
hand
round
the
refreshment
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
this
so
she
began
looking
at
everything
about
her
to
pas
away
the
time
alice
had
never
been
in
a
court
of
justice
before
but
she
had
read
about
them
in
book
and
she
wa
quite
pleased
to
find
that
she
knew
the
name
of
nearly
everything
there
`that
's
the
judge
she
said
to
herself
`because
of
his
great
wig
the
judge
by
the
way
wa
the
king
and
a
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
wig
look
at
the
frontispiece
if
you
want
to
see
how
he
did
it
he
did
not
look
at
all
comfortable
and
it
wa
certainly
not
becoming
`and
that
's
the
jury-box
thought
alice
`and
those
twelve
creature
she
wa
obliged
to
say
`creatures
you
see
because
some
of
them
were
animal
and
some
were
bird
`i
suppose
they
are
the
juror
she
said
this
last
word
two
or
three
time
over
to
herself
being
rather
proud
of
it
for
she
thought
and
rightly
too
that
very
few
little
girl
of
her
age
knew
the
meaning
of
it
at
all
however
`jury-men
would
have
done
just
a
well
the
twelve
juror
were
all
writing
very
busily
on
slate
`what
are
they
doing
alice
whispered
to
the
gryphon
`they
ca
n't
have
anything
to
put
down
yet
before
the
trial
's
begun
`they
're
putting
down
their
name
the
gryphon
whispered
in
reply
`for
fear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
end
of
the
trial
`stupid
thing
alice
began
in
a
loud
indignant
voice
but
she
stopped
hastily
for
the
white
rabbit
cried
out
`silence
in
the
court
and
the
king
put
on
his
spectacle
and
looked
anxiously
round
to
make
out
who
wa
talking
alice
could
see
a
well
a
if
she
were
looking
over
their
shoulder
that
all
the
juror
were
writing
down
`stupid
thing
on
their
slate
and
she
could
even
make
out
that
one
of
them
did
n't
know
how
to
spell
`stupid
and
that
he
had
to
ask
his
neighbour
to
tell
him
`a
nice
muddle
their
slate
'll
be
in
before
the
trial
's
over
thought
alice
one
of
the
juror
had
a
pencil
that
squeaked
this
of
course
alice
could
not
stand
and
she
went
round
the
court
and
got
behind
him
and
very
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
taking
it
away
she
did
it
so
quickly
that
the
poor
little
juror
it
wa
bill
the
lizard
could
not
make
out
at
all
what
had
become
of
it
so
after
hunting
all
about
for
it
he
wa
obliged
to
write
with
one
finger
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
this
wa
of
very
little
use
a
it
left
no
mark
on
the
slate
`herald
read
the
accusation
said
the
king
on
this
the
white
rabbit
blew
three
blast
on
the
trumpet
and
then
unrolled
the
parchment
scroll
and
read
a
follows
--
`the
queen
of
heart
she
made
some
tart
all
on
a
summer
day
the
knave
of
heart
he
stole
those
tart
and
took
them
quite
away
`consider
your
verdict
the
king
said
to
the
jury
`not
yet
not
yet
the
rabbit
hastily
interrupted
`there's
a
great
deal
to
come
before
that
`call
the
first
witness
said
the
king
and
the
white
rabbit
blew
three
blast
on
the
trumpet
and
called
out
`first
witness
the
first
witness
wa
the
hatter
he
came
in
with
a
teacup
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
bread-and-butter
in
the
other
`i
beg
pardon
your
majesty
he
began
`for
bringing
these
in
but
i
had
n't
quite
finished
my
tea
when
i
wa
sent
for
`you
ought
to
have
finished
said
the
king
`when
did
you
begin
the
hatter
looked
at
the
march
hare
who
had
followed
him
into
the
court
arm-in-arm
with
the
dormouse
`fourteenth
of
march
i
think
it
wa
he
said
`fifteenth
said
the
march
hare
`sixteenth
added
the
dormouse
`write
that
down
the
king
said
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
eagerly
wrote
down
all
three
date
on
their
slate
and
then
added
them
up
and
reduced
the
answer
to
shilling
and
penny
`take
off
your
hat
the
king
said
to
the
hatter
`it
is
n't
mine
said
the
hatter
`stolen
the
king
exclaimed
turning
to
the
jury
who
instantly
made
a
memorandum
of
the
fact
`i
keep
them
to
sell
the
hatter
added
a
an
explanation
`i
've
none
of
my
own
i
'm
a
hatter
here
the
queen
put
on
her
spectacle
and
began
staring
at
the
hatter
who
turned
pale
and
fidgeted
`give
your
evidence
said
the
king
`and
do
n't
be
nervous
or
i
'll
have
you
executed
on
the
spot
this
did
not
seem
to
encourage
the
witness
at
all
he
kept
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
looking
uneasily
at
the
queen
and
in
his
confusion
he
bit
a
large
piece
out
of
his
teacup
instead
of
the
bread-and-butter
just
at
this
moment
alice
felt
a
very
curious
sensation
which
puzzled
her
a
good
deal
until
she
made
out
what
it
wa
she
wa
beginning
to
grow
larger
again
and
she
thought
at
first
she
would
get
up
and
leave
the
court
but
on
second
thought
she
decided
to
remain
where
she
wa
a
long
a
there
wa
room
for
her
`i
wish
you
would
n't
squeeze
so
said
the
dormouse
who
wa
sitting
next
to
her
`i
can
hardly
breathe
`i
ca
n't
help
it
said
alice
very
meekly
`i
'm
growing
`you
've
no
right
to
grow
here
said
the
dormouse
`do
n't
talk
nonsense
said
alice
more
boldly
`you
know
you
're
growing
too
`yes
but
i
grow
at
a
reasonable
pace
said
the
dormouse
`not
in
that
ridiculous
fashion
and
he
got
up
very
sulkily
and
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
court
all
this
time
the
queen
had
never
left
off
staring
at
the
hatter
and
just
a
the
dormouse
crossed
the
court
she
said
to
one
of
the
officer
of
the
court
`bring
me
the
list
of
the
singer
in
the
last
concert
on
which
the
wretched
hatter
trembled
so
that
he
shook
both
his
shoe
off
`give
your
evidence
the
king
repeated
angrily
`or
i
'll
have
you
executed
whether
you
're
nervous
or
not
`i
'm
a
poor
man
your
majesty
the
hatter
began
in
a
trembling
voice
--
and
i
had
n't
begun
my
tea
--
not
above
a
week
or
so
--
and
what
with
the
bread-and-butter
getting
so
thin
--
and
the
twinkling
of
the
tea
--
`the
twinkling
of
the
what
said
the
king
`it
began
with
the
tea
the
hatter
replied
`of
course
twinkling
begin
with
a
t
said
the
king
sharply
`do
you
take
me
for
a
dunce
go
on
`i
'm
a
poor
man
the
hatter
went
on
`and
most
thing
twinkled
after
that
--
only
the
march
hare
said
--
`i
did
n't
the
march
hare
interrupted
in
a
great
hurry
`you
did
said
the
hatter
`i
deny
it
said
the
march
hare
`he
denies
it
said
the
king
`leave
out
that
part
`well
at
any
rate
the
dormouse
said
--
the
hatter
went
on
looking
anxiously
round
to
see
if
he
would
deny
it
too
but
the
dormouse
denied
nothing
being
fast
asleep
`after
that
continued
the
hatter
`i
cut
some
more
bread-
and-butter
--
`but
what
did
the
dormouse
say
one
of
the
jury
asked
`that
i
ca
n't
remember
said
the
hatter
`you
must
remember
remarked
the
king
`or
i
'll
have
you
executed
the
miserable
hatter
dropped
his
teacup
and
bread-and-butter
and
went
down
on
one
knee
`i
'm
a
poor
man
your
majesty
he
began
`you
're
a
very
poor
speaker
said
the
king
here
one
of
the
guinea-pigs
cheered
and
wa
immediately
suppressed
by
the
officer
of
the
court
a
that
is
rather
a
hard
word
i
will
just
explain
to
you
how
it
wa
done
they
had
a
large
canvas
bag
which
tied
up
at
the
mouth
with
string
into
this
they
slipped
the
guinea-pig
head
first
and
then
sat
upon
it
`i
'm
glad
i
've
seen
that
done
thought
alice
`i
've
so
often
read
in
the
newspaper
at
the
end
of
trial
``
there
wa
some
attempt
at
applause
which
wa
immediately
suppressed
by
the
officer
of
the
court
''
and
i
never
understood
what
it
meant
till
now
`if
that
's
all
you
know
about
it
you
may
stand
down
continued
the
king
`i
ca
n't
go
no
lower
said
the
hatter
`i
'm
on
the
floor
a
it
is
`then
you
may
sit
down
the
king
replied
here
the
other
guinea-pig
cheered
and
wa
suppressed
`come
that
finished
the
guinea-pigs
thought
alice
`now
we
shall
get
on
better
`i
'd
rather
finish
my
tea
said
the
hatter
with
an
anxious
look
at
the
queen
who
wa
reading
the
list
of
singer
`you
may
go
said
the
king
and
the
hatter
hurriedly
left
the
court
without
even
waiting
to
put
his
shoe
on
--
and
just
take
his
head
off
outside
the
queen
added
to
one
of
the
officer
but
the
hatter
wa
out
of
sight
before
the
officer
could
get
to
the
door
`call
the
next
witness
said
the
king
the
next
witness
wa
the
duchess
's
cook
she
carried
the
pepper-box
in
her
hand
and
alice
guessed
who
it
wa
even
before
she
got
into
the
court
by
the
way
the
people
near
the
door
began
sneezing
all
at
once
`give
your
evidence
said
the
king
`sha
n't
said
the
cook
the
king
looked
anxiously
at
the
white
rabbit
who
said
in
a
low
voice
`your
majesty
must
cross-examine
this
witness
`well
if
i
must
i
must
the
king
said
with
a
melancholy
air
and
after
folding
his
arm
and
frowning
at
the
cook
till
his
eye
were
nearly
out
of
sight
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
`what
are
tart
made
of
`pepper
mostly
said
the
cook
`treacle
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her
`collar
that
dormouse
the
queen
shrieked
out
`behead
that
dormouse
turn
that
dormouse
out
of
court
suppress
him
pinch
him
off
with
his
whisker
for
some
minute
the
whole
court
wa
in
confusion
getting
the
dormouse
turned
out
and
by
the
time
they
had
settled
down
again
the
cook
had
disappeared
`never
mind
said
the
king
with
an
air
of
great
relief
`call
the
next
witness
and
he
added
in
an
undertone
to
the
queen
`really
my
dear
you
must
cross-examine
the
next
witness
it
quite
make
my
forehead
ache
alice
watched
the
white
rabbit
a
he
fumbled
over
the
list
feeling
very
curious
to
see
what
the
next
witness
would
be
like
--
for
they
have
n't
got
much
evidence
yet
she
said
to
herself
imagine
her
surprise
when
the
white
rabbit
read
out
at
the
top
of
his
shrill
little
voice
the
name
`alice
chapter
xii
alice
's
evidence
`here
cried
alice
quite
forgetting
in
the
flurry
of
the
moment
how
large
she
had
grown
in
the
last
few
minute
and
she
jumped
up
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
tipped
over
the
jury-box
with
the
edge
of
her
skirt
upsetting
all
the
juryman
on
to
the
head
of
the
crowd
below
and
there
they
lay
sprawling
about
reminding
her
very
much
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
accidentally
upset
the
week
before
`oh
i
beg
your
pardon
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
great
dismay
and
began
picking
them
up
again
a
quickly
a
she
could
for
the
accident
of
the
goldfish
kept
running
in
her
head
and
she
had
a
vague
sort
of
idea
that
they
must
be
collected
at
once
and
put
back
into
the
jury-box
or
they
would
die
`the
trial
can
not
proceed
said
the
king
in
a
very
grave
voice
`until
all
the
juryman
are
back
in
their
proper
place
--
all
he
repeated
with
great
emphasis
looking
hard
at
alice
a
he
said
do
alice
looked
at
the
jury-box
and
saw
that
in
her
haste
she
had
put
the
lizard
in
head
downwards
and
the
poor
little
thing
wa
waving
it
tail
about
in
a
melancholy
way
being
quite
unable
to
move
she
soon
got
it
out
again
and
put
it
right
`not
that
it
signifies
much
she
said
to
herself
`i
should
think
it
would
be
quite
a
much
use
in
the
trial
one
way
up
a
the
other
a
soon
a
the
jury
had
a
little
recovered
from
the
shock
of
being
upset
and
their
slate
and
pencil
had
been
found
and
handed
back
to
them
they
set
to
work
very
diligently
to
write
out
a
history
of
the
accident
all
except
the
lizard
who
seemed
too
much
overcome
to
do
anything
but
sit
with
it
mouth
open
gazing
up
into
the
roof
of
the
court
`what
do
you
know
about
this
business
the
king
said
to
alice
`nothing
said
alice
`nothing
whatever
persisted
the
king
`nothing
whatever
said
alice
`that
's
very
important
the
king
said
turning
to
the
jury
they
were
just
beginning
to
write
this
down
on
their
slate
when
the
white
rabbit
interrupted
`unimportant
your
majesty
mean
of
course
he
said
in
a
very
respectful
tone
but
frowning
and
making
face
at
him
a
he
spoke
`unimportant
of
course
i
meant
the
king
hastily
said
and
went
on
to
himself
in
an
undertone
`important
--
unimportant
--
unimportant
--
important
--
a
if
he
were
trying
which
word
sounded
best
some
of
the
jury
wrote
it
down
`important
and
some
`unimportant
alice
could
see
this
a
she
wa
near
enough
to
look
over
their
slate
`but
it
doe
n't
matter
a
bit
she
thought
to
herself
at
this
moment
the
king
who
had
been
for
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
note-book
cackled
out
`silence
and
read
out
from
his
book
`rule
forty-two
all
person
more
than
a
mile
high
to
leave
the
court
everybody
looked
at
alice
`i
'm
not
a
mile
high
said
alice
`you
are
said
the
king
`nearly
two
mile
high
added
the
queen
`well
i
sha
n't
go
at
any
rate
said
alice
`besides
that
's
not
a
regular
rule
you
invented
it
just
now
`it
's
the
oldest
rule
in
the
book
said
the
king
`then
it
ought
to
be
number
one
said
alice
the
king
turned
pale
and
shut
his
note-book
hastily
`consider
your
verdict
he
said
to
the
jury
in
a
low
trembling
voice
`there
's
more
evidence
to
come
yet
please
your
majesty
said
the
white
rabbit
jumping
up
in
a
great
hurry
`this
paper
ha
just
been
picked
up
`what
's
in
it
said
the
queen
`i
have
n't
opened
it
yet
said
the
white
rabbit
`but
it
seems
to
be
a
letter
written
by
the
prisoner
to
--
to
somebody
`it
must
have
been
that
said
the
king
`unless
it
wa
written
to
nobody
which
is
n't
usual
you
know
`who
is
it
directed
to
said
one
of
the
juryman
`it
is
n't
directed
at
all
said
the
white
rabbit
`in
fact
there
's
nothing
written
on
the
outside
he
unfolded
the
paper
a
he
spoke
and
added
`it
is
n't
a
letter
after
all
it
's
a
set
of
verse
`are
they
in
the
prisoner
's
handwriting
asked
another
of
the
juryman
`no
they
're
not
said
the
white
rabbit
`and
that
's
the
queerest
thing
about
it
the
jury
all
looked
puzzled
`he
must
have
imitated
somebody
else
's
hand
said
the
king
the
jury
all
brightened
up
again
`please
your
majesty
said
the
knave
`i
did
n't
write
it
and
they
ca
n't
prove
i
did
there
's
no
name
signed
at
the
end
`if
you
did
n't
sign
it
said
the
king
`that
only
make
the
matter
worse
you
must
have
meant
some
mischief
or
else
you'd
have
signed
your
name
like
an
honest
man
there
wa
a
general
clapping
of
hand
at
this
it
wa
the
first
really
clever
thing
the
king
had
said
that
day
`that
prof
his
guilt
said
the
queen
`it
prof
nothing
of
the
sort
said
alice
`why
you
don't
even
know
what
they
're
about
`read
them
said
the
king
the
white
rabbit
put
on
his
spectacle
`where
shall
i
begin
please
your
majesty
he
asked
`begin
at
the
beginning
the
king
said
gravely
`and
go
on
till
you
come
to
the
end
then
stop
these
were
the
verse
the
white
rabbit
read
--
`they
told
me
you
had
been
to
her
and
mentioned
me
to
him
she
gave
me
a
good
character
but
said
i
could
not
swim
he
sent
them
word
i
had
not
gone
we
know
it
to
be
true
if
she
should
push
the
matter
on
what
would
become
of
you
i
gave
her
one
they
gave
him
two
you
gave
u
three
or
more
they
all
returned
from
him
to
you
though
they
were
mine
before

to
be
involved
in
this
affair
he

to
you
to
set
them
free
exactly
a
we
were
my
notion
wa
that
you
had
been
before
she
had
this
fit
an
obstacle
that
came
between
him
and
ourselves
and
it
do
n't
let
him
know
she
liked
them
best
for
this
must
ever
be
a
secret
kept
from
all
the
rest
between
yourself
and
me
`that
's
the
most
important
piece
of
evidence
we
've
heard
yet
said
the
king
rubbing
his
hand
`so
now
let
the
jury
--
`if
any
one
of
them
can
explain
it
said
alice
she
had
grown
so
large
in
the
last
few
minute
that
she
wa
n't
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him
`i
'll
give
him
sixpence
_i_
don't
believe
there
's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it
the
jury
all
wrote
down
on
their
slate
`she
doe
n't
believe
there
's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it
but
none
of
them
attempted
to
explain
the
paper
`if
there
's
no
meaning
in
it
said
the
king
`that
save
a
world
of
trouble
you
know
a
we
need
n't
try
to
find
any
and
yet
i
do
n't
know
he
went
on
spreading
out
the
verse
on
his
knee
and
looking
at
them
with
one
eye
`i
seem
to
see
some
meaning
in
them
after
all.
``
--
said
i
could
not
swim
--
''
you
ca
n't
swim
can
you
he
added
turning
to
the
knave
the
knave
shook
his
head
sadly
`do
i
look
like
it
he
said
which
he
certainly
did
not
being
made
entirely
of
cardboard
`all
right
so
far
said
the
king
and
he
went
on
muttering
over
the
verse
to
himself
''
we
know
it
to
be
true
--
''
that's
the
jury
of
course
--
``
i
gave
her
one
they
gave
him
two
--
''
why
that
must
be
what
he
did
with
the
tart
you
know
--
`but
it
go
on
``
they
all
returned
from
him
to
you
''
said
alice
`why
there
they
are
said
the
king
triumphantly
pointing
to
the
tart
on
the
table
`nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
then
again
--
''
before
she
had
this
fit
--
''
you
never
had
fit
my
dear
i
think
he
said
to
the
queen
`never
said
the
queen
furiously
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
lizard
a
she
spoke
the
unfortunate
little
bill
had
left
off
writing
on
his
slate
with
one
finger
a
he
found
it
made
no
mark
but
he
now
hastily
began
again
using
the
ink
that
wa
trickling
down
his
face
a
long
a
it
lasted
`then
the
word
do
n't
fit
you
said
the
king
looking
round
the
court
with
a
smile
there
wa
a
dead
silence
`it
's
a
pun
the
king
added
in
an
offended
tone
and
everybody
laughed
`let
the
jury
consider
their
verdict
the
king
said
for
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day
`no
no
said
the
queen
`sentence
first
--
verdict
afterwards
`stuff
and
nonsense
said
alice
loudly
`the
idea
of
having
the
sentence
first
`hold
your
tongue
said
the
queen
turning
purple
`i
wo
n't
said
alice
`off
with
her
head
the
queen
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
nobody
moved
`who
care
for
you
said
alice
she
had
grown
to
her
full
size
by
this
time
`you
're
nothing
but
a
pack
of
card
at
this
the
whole
pack
rose
up
into
the
air
and
came
flying
down
upon
her
she
gave
a
little
scream
half
of
fright
and
half
of
anger
and
tried
to
beat
them
off
and
found
herself
lying
on
the
bank
with
her
head
in
the
lap
of
her
sister
who
wa
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaf
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
tree
upon
her
face
`wake
up
alice
dear
said
her
sister
`why
what
a
long
sleep
you
've
had
`oh
i
've
had
such
a
curious
dream
said
alice
and
she
told
her
sister
a
well
a
she
could
remember
them
all
these
strange
adventure
of
hers
that
you
have
just
been
reading
about
and
when
she
had
finished
her
sister
kissed
her
and
said
`it
wa
a
curious
dream
dear
certainly
but
now
run
in
to
your
tea
it's
getting
late
so
alice
got
up
and
ran
off
thinking
while
she
ran
a
well
she
might
what
a
wonderful
dream
it
had
been
but
her
sister
sat
still
just
a
she
left
her
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
watching
the
setting
sun
and
thinking
of
little
alice
and
all
her
wonderful
adventure
till
she
too
began
dreaming
after
a
fashion
and
this
wa
her
dream
--
first
she
dreamed
of
little
alice
herself
and
once
again
the
tiny
hand
were
clasped
upon
her
knee
and
the
bright
eager
eye
were
looking
up
into
hers
--
she
could
hear
the
very
tone
of
her
voice
and
see
that
queer
little
toss
of
her
head
to
keep
back
the
wandering
hair
that
would
always
get
into
her
eye
--
and
still
a
she
listened
or
seemed
to
listen
the
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
the
strange
creature
of
her
little
sister
's
dream
the
long
grass
rustled
at
her
foot
a
the
white
rabbit
hurried
by
--
the
frightened
mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
neighbouring
pool
--
she
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
teacup
a
the
march
hare
and
his
friend
shared
their
never-ending
meal
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
queen
ordering
off
her
unfortunate
guest
to
execution
--
once
more
the
pig-baby
wa
sneezing
on
the
duchess
's
knee
while
plate
and
dish
crashed
around
it
--
once
more
the
shriek
of
the
gryphon
the
squeaking
of
the
lizard's
slate-pencil
and
the
choking
of
the
suppressed
guinea-pigs
filled
the
air
mixed
up
with
the
distant
sob
of
the
miserable
mock
turtle
so
she
sat
on
with
closed
eye
and
half
believed
herself
in
wonderland
though
she
knew
she
had
but
to
open
them
again
and
all
would
change
to
dull
reality
--
the
grass
would
be
only
rustling
in
the
wind
and
the
pool
rippling
to
the
waving
of
the
reed
--
the
rattling
teacup
would
change
to
tinkling
sheep-
bell
and
the
queen
's
shrill
cry
to
the
voice
of
the
shepherd
boy
--
and
the
sneeze
of
the
baby
the
shriek
of
the
gryphon
and
all
the
other
queer
noise
would
change
she
knew
to
the
confused
clamour
of
the
busy
farm-yard
--
while
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
in
the
distance
would
take
the
place
of
the
mock
turtle's
heavy
sob
lastly
she
pictured
to
herself
how
this
same
little
sister
of
hers
would
in
the
after-time
be
herself
a
grown
woman
and
how
she
would
keep
through
all
her
riper
year
the
simple
and
loving
heart
of
her
childhood
and
how
she
would
gather
about
her
other
little
child
and
make
their
eye
bright
and
eager
with
many
a
strange
tale
perhaps
even
with
the
dream
of
wonderland
of
long
ago
and
how
she
would
feel
with
all
their
simple
sorrow
and
find
a
pleasure
in
all
their
simple
joy
remembering
her
own
child-life
and
the
happy
summer
day
the
end
